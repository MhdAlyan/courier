Welcome to the Courier Socks 5 proxy library.

See NEWS for the latest Courier-specific Socks NEWS.

This is a generic Socks 5 client support library, and a Socks 5 server.

A typical "socksify" script is included, and will be installed.  Do not
install this Socks library on a system that already includes another
Socks library.  It is very likely that installing this library will overwrite
some files.
