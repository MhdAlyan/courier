Welcome to the Courier Socks 5 proxy toolkit

The Courier Socks 5 proxy toolkit now includes a server component.

The Socks 5 server supports both incoming and outgoing proxy connections,
authenticated or anonymous.

The Socks 5 server also supports blocking connections to large numbers of
blacklisted IP addresses.  The current impementation uses a binary database
that easily supports over a hundred thousand blacklisted IP address ranges.
A Perl script creates the binary database from a flat file in the common
IPv4 blacklist format.

Only TCP connections are supported.  Support for proxying UDP sockets is
not yet implemented.

You must install the Courier Authentication Library before building this
Socks 5 toolkit.  Download the Courier Authentication Library from
http://www.courier-mta.org/authlib

You must install this package before building Courier-MTA, if you want Socks 5
support in Courier.  If this package is installed before building Courier,
Courier will automatically compile the support for sending outgoing mail
through a Socks 5 proxy.
