  <h1>Calendaring in <code>SqWebMail</code></h1>

  <p>This is currently a work in progress. At this point, the
  calendaring implementation includes basic calendaring/scheduling
  resources.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Dogfood: "pcp" is the acronym for "Personal Calendaring
    Protocol".</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Enabling calendaring</h2>

  <p>To enable calendaring, create the file
  <code>calendarmode</code> in the configuration directory
  (<code>/usr/local/share/sqwebmail</code>, or
  <code>$sysconfdir</code>, usually
  <code>/usr/lib/courier/etc</code>). The <code>calendarmode</code>
  file should contain a single word: either "local" - enable
  account calendaring; or "net" - enable calendaring in groupware
  mode. Example:</p>
  <pre>
echo "local" &gt;calendarmode
</pre>

  <p>Additionally, if groupware calendaring is enabled, the
  <code>pcpd</code> daemon process must be started. This is now
  taken care of automatically by the sqwebmail startup script
  (<code>sqwebmaild.rc</code> script in the sqwebmail distribution,
  and the <code>webmaild</code> script in the Courier
  distribution). The next step is to set up individual access
  control lists, which are described below.</p>

  <blockquote>
    NOTE: if you've installed SqWebMail/Courier binary RPMs, the
    RPMs will automatically take care of starting <code>pcpd</code>
    at system boot time if groupware calendaring is enabled.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    NOTE: check your umask, <code>calendarmode</code> needs to be
    globally readable.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Technical implementation</h2>

  <p>There are two calendaring modes:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <h3>Local mode</h3>

    <p>Local calendar access requires very little additional
    resources, in addition to basic webmail support, and it needs
    very little overhead. Calendaring information is saved in
    <code>$HOME/Maildir/calendar</code>, which is automatically
    created during first webmail login after enabling
    calendaring.</p>

    <h3>Groupware mode</h3>

    <p>Groupware mode offer the ability to synchronize events on
    multiple calendar. Groupware mode requires additional server
    resources. A rule of thumb is that groupware mode will require
    between 10% and 100% of CPU and I/O bandwidth, when compared to
    basic webmail. Groupware may also require additional disk
    space, since copies of the event data is copied to each
    calendar. Events may have large attachments, so allow for
    plenty of disk space.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In all cases, calendaring is designed to be used in private,
  non-public settings. This calendaring implementation will not
  work well in a public webmail environment. Currently, quotas are
  not implemented on the calendar data. SqWebMail does not work
  with filesystem quotas. SqWebMail creates cached folder indexes,
  and an inability to create a folder index will result in a total
  application failure. SqWebMail does support a software quota
  implementation, however the software-based quota currently does
  not include calendaring data. This issue may be addressed in the
  future.</p>

  <p>This calendaring implementation is built on top of an API
  protocol library that is designed to be flexible and extensible.
  Only basic calendaring is implemented right now. The API library
  uses locks when accessing calendar data. Locks are not really
  necessary in local mode, but are needed for groupware mode. The
  API library uses dot-lock files, which are designed to work on a
  network filesystem, as long as the clocks on the clients and
  servers are synchronized. When a network filesystem is used it is
  essential to make sure that the clocks on all machines are
  synchronized with NTP, or an equivalent clock synchronization
  protocol.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Basic calendaring allows creation and modification of calendar
  events. A calendar event is handled similarly to mail messages. A
  calendar event has a subject, and a description. It is possible
  to attach files to calendar events, similar to how files can be
  attached to messages. This is mainly useful in groupware mode.
  Note however that group events place individual copies of the
  event on each calendar, and large attachments can quickly eat up
  storage space.</p>

  <p>Individual events may be marked as cancelled, or completely
  removed from the calendar. A cancelled event still appears on the
  calendar, but new events will not check events marked as
  cancelled for scheduling conflicts. Adding a new event checks
  only non-cancelled events for any scheduling conflicts.</p>

  <p>Events are created and edited like regular E-mail messages.
  Until an event is added to the calendar, it is saved in the
  Drafts folder while it is being edited. To cancel an event
  without saving it on the calendar, open the Drafts folder, and
  delete it.</p>

  <h2>Groupware Calendaring</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <hr />

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Groupware calendaring is experimental
    at this time. If you're using groupware calendaring on
    platforms that PAM for authentication, be sure to configure the
    PAM library to authenticate the "calendar" service.</p>
    <hr />
  </blockquote>

  <p>It is helpful to know how groupware mode is implemented, in
  order not to be surprised by some of its quirks. The details of
  initializing groupware mode have already been covered, and are
  not repeated here.</p>

  <p>Groupware mode works essentially by replicating calendar
  events across multiple calendaring. Whoever creates a calendar
  event specifies additional "participants". When groupware
  calendaring is enabled, additional fields on the New Event screen
  are used to enter additional participants' E-mail address. All
  participants' mailboxes must reside on the same server. In far
  distant future it will be possible to cluster <code>pcpd</code>
  across multiple servers. When the event is saved, the
  <code>pcpd</code> daemon replicates the event to all
  participants' calendars. Subsequent modifications to the event
  are similarly replicated.</p>

  <p>But, before all this happens, it is necessary to set up access
  control lists. Access control lists determine who is authorized
  to place events on whose calendars. You wouldn't want everyone,
  and their aunt, to place random events on your calendar, do
  you?</p>

  <p>The preferences screen will have a link on the bottom to a
  separate preferences page where access controls are entered. To
  allow someone to place events on your calendar, add their E-mail
  address to your access control list. Right now, two access
  controls are available:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>MODIFY</code> - allow this address to add/modify
    events to your calendar.</li>

    <li><code>CONFLICT</code> - allow this address to add/modify
    events to your calendar which have scheduling conflicts with
    existing events. <code>CONFLICT</code> implies
    <code>MODIFY</code> and <code>MODIFY</code> must be selected
    also, in order for <code>CONFLICT</code> to work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Everyone is responsible for setting up their own access
  control lists. Right now, the "MODIFY" access control is always
  selected, because that's the only thing that makes sense. There
  will be other access controls added, in some distance
  future...</p>

  <h3>Updating groupware events</h3>

  <p>Only the original person who created an event is capable of
  modifying it. Other event participants may also mark the event as
  cancelled on their calendar, but should not make any other
  changes. Remember that the event creator is responsible for
  propagating event updates. A participant can still make changes
  to that event, but those changes will not be replicated, because
  only the event on the creator's calendar has the necessary
  internal replication linkage. If a participant modifies a
  replicated event, if the original creator makes any subsequent
  updates, the replication process won't be able to automatically
  delete the original event on the participant's calendar, to be
  replaced with the updated event. The original replicated event is
  gone, it's been updated on the participant's calendar. The
  updated event looks like a completely separate event, which
  probably has the same starting/ending times, and will trigger a
  scheduling conflict.</p>

  <p>Participants may mark replicated events as cancelled, which
  will not break the replication link. That's what
  cancelling/uncancelling was originally designed for. A
  participant may try to completely delete the replicated event,
  but it'll be back if the original event creator updates the
  event, which will cause it to be replicated back again out to
  everyone's calendar.</p>

  <p>The original event creator may add/remove participants as part
  of updating the event. The event will be properly added/removed
  from the affected calendars, accordingly (and hopefully).</p>

  <p>Suppose an event has been replicated to someone's calendar,
  and this participant then went ahead and removed the creator's
  access control list entry. If the original event creator attempts
  to save an update to the event, the update will fail to
  authorize. There's an additional option on the new/update event
  page called "Ignore errors updating other participants'
  calendars". That's self-explanatory - this error condition will
  be ignored, and the offender is automatically removed from this
  event's list of participants.</p>

  <h3>Entering E-mail addresses</h3>

  <p>As described previously, groupware events are created by
  entering the participant's E-mail addresses. For this document's
  purposes, an "E-mail address" means the login ID that's provided
  to log into SqWebMail. Someone may customize their From: header,
  but that doesn't count. It's their webmail login address that
  matters.</p>

  <p>The E-mail address should include @domain. If absent, it will
  default to the creator's login E-mail domain. Therefore, in most
  cases it's not really necessary to explicitly tack on @domain
  when entering E-mail addresses, the default will be correct most
  of the time. If the default is wrong, it will be very
  obvious.</p>

  <p>The calendaring screens automatically check the address book,
  when displaying events. If the E-mail address is found in the
  address book, the calendaring screens will quietly show the
  person's name, in addition to the E-mail address. Initialize
  those address books.</p>

  <h2>Issues</h2>

  <p>There are some minor design issues that may be addressed in
  the future. Some of them are already obvious, from the preceding
  documentation.</p>

  <h3>Event updates</h3>

  <p>An existing event is updated essentially by making a copy of
  it, and saving the updated event as a new event, while
  simultaneously deleting the old event. It's possible to open an
  existing event, for editing, more than once. If one copy of the
  event is placed back to the calendar, the old event information
  is removed, and the new event information takes its place. If
  another, previously opened, copy of the old event is opened from
  the Drafts folder, edited and saved, the updated event already on
  the calendar is NOT removed, and essentially another event is
  added to the calendar (assuming no scheduling conflicts with the
  previously updated copy of the event).</p>

  <p>This should not be a major issue, since a scheduling conflict
  will be reported in most cases, thus bringing this issue to
  light. Note that it's always possible to manually override any
  scheduling conflicts, and place conflicting events on the
  calendar, but a manual override is always required. It's also
  possible to detect an attempt to save a duplicate updated,
  because the old event is no longer on the calendar, however this
  will raise other issues concerning groupware mode. The current
  approach is the simplest way to implement editing of existing
  events, and any complications can always be easily fixed by
  hand.</p>

  <h3>Expired calendar events</h3>

  <p>Calendar events are automatically deleted 30 days after their
  last occurence.</p>

  <h3>Recurring events</h3>

  <p>When asked to generate weekly/monthly/annual recurring dates
  for an event, until a certain date, the system stops after
  generating 100 dates. This is to prevent bad input from
  generating a huge list.</p>

  <h3>Limitations</h3>

  <p>On most systems, calendaring works only until year 2038, when
  the 32 bit time counter wraps around. On 64-bit systems
  calendaring will work beyond year 2038.</p>

  <h3>Localization</h3>

  <p>Calendaring get the date/time format, names of the days of the
  week, and names of the months of the year, from the locale
  settings. The calendar's locale can be set by initializing
  <code>html/en-us/LOCALE</code> (in the stock tarball) which is
  installed either in <code>/usr/local/share/sqwebmail</code> or
  <code>/usr/lib/courier/share/sqwebmail</code> by default. Note
  that the LOCALE setting will be reflected in all other SqWebMail
  functions. If the locale text uses a character set other than
  <code>iso-8859-1</code> then it will also be necessary to
  initialize the CHARSET file.</p>

  <p>If the locale is changed, the sample dates in
  <code>html/en-us/newevent.html</code> may also need changed to
  reflect the locale's weekday and month names. Date entry in
  calendaring uses the locale's weekday and month names as well.
  The strings 'tomorrow' and 'today' are also set in the
  <code>newevent.html</code> file - look inside the hidden comments
  at the beginning of this file.</p>

  <blockquote>
    NOTE: SqWebMail accepts dates either in MM/DD/YYYY or
    YYYY.MM.DD no matter what locale is in effect. This is for
    ENTERING dates only - the dates are always displayed according
    to the current locale This will be fixed in a future release.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    NOTE: Error messages generated by the internal calendaring
    protocol library are in English, and at this time there is no
    flexible mechanism to localize them. This will be fixed in a
    future release.
