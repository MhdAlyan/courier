<h2><a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>This is experimental beta of GnuPG support in <code>SqWebMail</code>. The
following functionality is available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create new keypairs<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>List public/private keys<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Delete keys<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Sign keys<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Export keys (attach them to the current message)<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Import keys from messages<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Sign outgoing messages<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Encrypt outgoing messages<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Display and verify signed messages<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Decrypt encrypted messages<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Reply and forward encrypted messages.  Correctly handle
    multipart/alternative and multipart/related.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code>SqWebMail</code> creates and manages its own keyrings.
<code>$HOME/.gnupg</code> is not used. This allows GnuPG functions to work
for virtual accounts that have no home directory.</p>

<h2><a name="require" id="require">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>This implementation requires GnuPG, which is used for all of the heavy
lifting.  No encryption code exists in <code>SqWebMail</code> itself. The
configuration script searches the current PATH for the <code>gpg</code>
binary. The final <code>SqWebMail</code> binary gets the hardcoded absolute
path to the <code>gpg</code> binary. If <code>gpg</code> is not found in the
current PATH, <code>/usr/bin/gpg</code> will be used. Therefore, if GnuPG is
locally installed in a non-default location, make sure that <code>gpg</code>
can be found in the current PATH.</p>

<h2><a name="implementation" id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

<p><code><code>SqWebMail</code></code> runs <code>gpg</code> automatically to
handle all the actual tasks involved in encrypting and decrypting messages.
<code>make install</code> also installs two more binaries:
<code>reformime</code> and <code>mimegpg</code>. Those binaries do some other
things, and nothing really needs to be done about them, or to them, except to
know that they're there.</p>

<h3>The <code>webgpg</code> script</h3>
<code>make install</code> automatically installs a shell script,
<code>webgpg</code>. Encryption/decryption capabilities for all mail accounts
are disabled by default. The <code>webgpg</code> script takes one argument -
the complete pathname to a Maildir. <code>webgpg</code> creates a new
subdirectory, <code>Maildir/gpg</code>, and initializes it. Once that
subdirectory is created, encryption/decryption in <code>SqWebMail</code> will
become available for that account. Not every mail account has to have
encryption/decryption enabled. This functionality can be selectively enabled
and disabled for individual accounts.

<p>NOTE: <code>webgpg</code> script MUST be executed by the same userid and
groupid that owns the <code>Maildir</code> directory.</p>

<p>NOTE: The current implementation consists of the bare minimum required to
get the overall functionality.  As a result, a number of shortcuts are taken
with respect to avoiding some hoops that GnuPG occasionally requires to be
jumped through.  For example, by default GnuPG requires that a public key
must be signed before it can be used for encryption.  <code>SqWebMail</code>
will automatically provide the "always-trust" option to bypass the check.
Basically, if you have the public key in your keyring, you can use it.</p>

<h3>Issues with adding or activating encryption for existing accounts</h3>

<p>Obviously, encryption/decryption takes additional server CPU cycles. There
is no hard and fast rule for how much additional load is needed. Fortunately,
this is not an "all or none" deal. Encryption support can be activated in a
controlled manner and phased in gradually, in steps, allowing the impact on
the web/mail server to be closely monitored, and controlled.</p>

<h3>Issues with adding or activating encryption for new accounts</h3>

<p>The <code>webgpg</code> script needs to be used to initialize encryption
support for newly-created accounts.  Many systems use the
<code>/etc/skel</code> directory as a template for setting up the initial
contents of new accounts.  In that case, use run "<code>webgpg
/etc/skel/Maildir</code>", and all new accounts will have encryption
automatically activated.</p>

<h2><a name="interop" id="interop">Interoperability</a></h2>

<p>As of now, <code>SqWebMail</code>'s encryption/decryption is experimental.
There's not been much interoperability testing with other encryption-capable
mail software.  It is very much possible that there are some interoperability
issues that will have to be worked out.</p>

<p>The directory <code>Maildir/gpg</code> does pretty much what
<code>$HOME/.gnupg</code> does for the command-line <code>gpg</code> tool.
<code>SqWebMail</code> does not use <code>$HOME/.gnupg</code>, it keeps its
keyrings and other GnuPG-related stuff in the <code>Maildir/gpg</code>
directory. That's because <code>SqWebMail</code> can be configured to use
both physical system accounts and virtual mail accounts, and after
authenticating, there is no difference whatsoever between the two. Therefore,
<code>SqWebMail</code> has no concept of the $HOME directory. Its entire
universe consists of the <code>Maildir</code> directory, and its contents.
<code>SqWebMail</code> is completely unaware of the existence of
<code>$HOME/.gnupg</code>, and will never be aware of it. Any keypairs in
<code>$HOME/.gnupg</code> will have to be imported into
<code>Maildir/gpg</code>.</p>

<h3>Importing keys</h3>

<p>Since <code>$HOME/.gnupg</code> is not used, any existing keys will have
to be imported.  If shell access is available, the <code>pubring</code> and
<code>secring</code> files can simply be copied to <code>Maildir/gpg</code>.
The following procedure can be used to import keys in all other
circumstances. The following example imports keys from mail account M to
<code>SqWebMail</code> mail account W.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a temporary keypair in W.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Create a new message, addressed to M, attach the new public key, and
    send it.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>In M, take the new public key and import it.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Export M's secret key.  With GnuPG, use the following command:
    <pre>gpg --export-secret-key --armor [fingerprint]</pre>
    <p>The output from this command looks something like this:</p>

    </code></li>

</ul>

<h2><a name="passphrase" id="passphrase">Using passphrase-protected private
keys</a></h2>

<p>SqWebMail can handle passphrase-protected keys only when SSL is being
used. This is an artificial restriction that prevents passphrases from going
over the network, in the clear. When SSL is used, SqWebMail will
automatically prompt for a passphrase. Leave the passphrase field empty if
the secret key is not protected by a passphrase.</p>

<h2><a name="bugs" id="bugs">Bugs</a></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Although <code>SqWebMail</code> contains mappings for many charsets,
    GnuPG versions prior to 1.0.6 know only about <code>iso-8859-1</code> and
    <code>iso-8859-2</code>. All messages displayed by <code>SqWebMail</code>
    from GnuPG 1.0.5 or earlier will come out in <code>iso-8859-1</code>. <br
    />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Currently, there are no command line options in GnuPG for removing key
    signatures (is that even possible?).  You can sign keys, but can't
    "unsign" them.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>There has not been any/much interoperability testing with other
    GnuPG/PGP mail software.  It is entirely possible that
    <code>SqWebMail</code>'s implementation is currently not interoperable,
    and may require some tinkering as time goes by.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>GnuPG will always blather "Warning: secret key NOT protected" when
    using keys not protected by a passphrase. This whinge is harmless, and
    can be ignored.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The error message from GnuPG for a missing passphrase is not very
    helpful: "Unable to get tty input". This is because SqWebMail runs GnuPG
    with the --no-tty flag, and provides a passphrase separately, when it's
    entered. When SqWebMail does not provide a passphrase, GnuPG complains
    that tty input is disabled.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="random" id="random">Important note for Linux and other systems
that use the <code>/dev/random</code> device.</a></h2>

<p>If GnuPG is compiled on a system that has a <code>/dev/random</code>
device, GnuPG will use the <code>/dev/random</code> device as a source for
random entropy. The <code>/dev/random</code> device driver in Linux, and in
many other implementations, creates the entropy pool from system device
driver background activity. Unfortunately, it's is not a bottomless pit of
random entropy. When the random device driver entropy pool is empty,
<code>/dev/random</code> halts until device drivers create more noise.</p>

<p>That means that when GnuPG is used on Linux, GnuPG may pause for an
excessive period of time, and issue its famous "please do something" prompt.
Since GnuPG is invoked in automatic mode, there is no other alternative,
except to wait until more device driver noise becomes available.</p>

<p>This is more likely to happen when GnuPG is used to create new keypairs,
especially ones that are 1024 bits, or longer. Before deploying, extensive
testing is recommended to make sure that even an idle system generates
sufficient background noise so that the additional wait is not excessive.
There are several possible solutions that can also be used:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GnuPG can be optionally configured to use a pseudo-random generator
    that does not use <code>/dev/random</code>, but instead uses several
    alternative sources of random junk. Consult GnuPG's documentation for
    more information.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Many systems also have a <code>/dev/urandom</code> device, which
    automatically generates pseudo-random noise if <code>/dev/random</code>
    runs out of entropy. This makes it possible to simply remove the
    <code>/dev/random</code> device and create a link from
    <code>/dev/random</code> to <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Although - technically - both approaches can theoretically result in
slightly less secure keypairs, practically the difference is probably
academic in nature.</p>
