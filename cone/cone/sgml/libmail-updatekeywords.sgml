  <title>Keywords</title>

  <para>
Keywords are application-defined flags, or markers, that are associated
which each message in a folder.
Keywords names are arbitrary, and are subject to certain restrictions.
&libname; does not place any special meaning on any particular keyword
name.
&libname;'s sole involvement is to store the save the list of keywords set
for a given message, and then retrieve it upon demand.</para>

  <para>
Which characters may be included in a keyword name depends on the underlying
account type.
Applications that expect to use any supported account type should limit
themselves to the lowest common denominator: case insensitive
<literal>us-ascii</literal> character set; no whitespace or any of the
following characters: commas; apostrophes; quotes; backslashes;
forward slashes; opening/closing braces, brackets, and parenthesis;
question marks; asterisks; percent signs.
In all cases, keyword names may not include any control characters.
Unless keywords are permanently saved, and remain available after the
folder is closed, and subsequently reopened.
When the folder is reopened at some point later, all keywords will remain
set for their corresponding messages (unless they were modified by another
process).</para>
