<para>
This command opens the screen with a list of attachments to the current message.
This is the <quote>View Attachment</quote> screen.
It is a very simple screen: each attachment is listed, giving its MIME type
(the type of the attachment), its approximate size, and the
attachments's description, if provided.</para>

<para>
Plain text attachments may be viewed individually, by pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.
Press <keycap>S</keycap> to download and save the highlighted attachment.
Use <keycap>I</keycap> to return to the folder index screen, <keycap>L</keycap>
to return to the folder listing screen, and <keycap>M</keycap> to go back to the
main menu screen.</para>

<para>
After downloading an attachment it may be optionally deleted, or removed
from the message.
Press <keycap>D</keycap> to delete the highlighted attachment.
Pressing <keycap>D</keycap> does not delete the attachment immediately,
it only marks the attachment for deletion.
More than one attachment may be marked for deletion at the same time.
Press <keycap>X</keycap> to permanently remove all attachments that are
marked for deletion.
Beforing pressing <keycap>X</keycap>, a marked attachment can be unmarked by
pressing <keycap>U</keycap>.
Once <keycap>X</keycap> is pressed all the deleted attachments are gone for
good, and cannot be undeleted.</para>

<note>
  <para>
Only messages in local mail folders, IMAP folders, and POP3 maildrop folders
may have their attachments removed.
Messages in POP3 folders and NetNews folders cannot have their attachments
removed.</para>
</note>

<para>
When <application>GnuPG</application> is installed, highlighting an attachment
that contains GPG/PGP keys and pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap> imports the
keys. &app; prompts for a confirmation, then runs
<application>GnuPG</application> to import the attached keys.
Some versions of <application>Gnu</application> require a special procedure
for importing private keys.
&app;'s prompt has an explicit private key export option.
With other versions of <application>GnuPG</application> this option doesn't
matter.
Selecting the default import option will import whatever keys were attached,
public or private.</para>

<para>
When running in an X-terminal, highlighting an image attachment and pressing
<keycap>ENTER</keycap> displays the image in a separate window.
This is done by running either Gnome's <application>eog</application>, or
KDE's <application>kview</application> image viewer.
&app;'s manual page contains instructions for installing hooks for viewing
other kinds of attachments, or using a different image viewer.</para>
