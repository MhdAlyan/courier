Some mail servers reserve certain characters which cannot be used in
folder names.
IMAP mail servers use a special character
(usually
"<literal>/</literal>" or
"<literal>.</literal>")
as a separator between names in
a hierarchical folder path.
The actual character varies from server to server.
An attempt to create/rename a folder
whose name includes a reserved character will fail.
Different IMAP servers use different hierarchy separator characters.
An attempt to create a folder may fail on one IMAP server even if another
IMAP server can succesfully create a folder with the same name.
This is, unfortunately, a design flaw in the IMAP protocol.</para>

Maildir folders created by
are compatible
and can be read by the
<ulink url="http://www.courier-mta.org">Courier-IMAP</ulink>
server.
Names of maildir folders may contain any character, including
the characters
"<literal>:</literal>",
"<literal>/</literal>",
"<literal>.</literal>",
"<literal>~</literal>",
and
"<literal>:</literal>".
However, if the same folders are exported
via IMAP, folders whose name
includes these characters may not be readable by some IMAP clients.
Even a
&libname; application may not be able to read
one of these folders via IMAP.</para>

Mbox mail folders created by
&libname;
are mostly compatible
and can be exported by IMAP servers that read mbox-formatted mail folders
(with some limitations, such as that the same mbox folder cannot be
open by &libname; and another application at the
same time).
Names of mbox folders can contain any character, including
the characters
"<literal>/</literal>",
and
"<literal>~</literal>".
However if mbox folders are exported
via IMAP, folders whose name includes
these characters may not be readable by some IMAP clients.</para>
