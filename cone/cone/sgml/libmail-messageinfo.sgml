      <para>
This function returns an object with the following fields:</para>
      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>std::string uid</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
A unique ID that's assigned to each message in a folder.
Applications should consider this unique ID as a completely opaque string,
with no particular interpretation.
The only assumption that applications may make is that no two
messages will ever have the same uid in the same folder.
A message copied to another folder will receive a different unique ID
in the destination folder (the copy in the original folder is not
affected).</para>

This message flag is considered obsolete, and should only be used by IMAP-based
clients that absolutely need this flag.
Applications that absolutely require this flag should be evaluated for
correctness, since the IMAP specification indicates that this flag's
setting is not defined in situations where the same mail folder is opened
by multiple applications at the same time.
Since this is nearly always the case, it seems that this flag's usability
is rather limited.
For this reason, the <literal>recent</literal> flag was not reimplemented
in <link linkend="smap1">SMAP</link>, and will not
be set for accounts that are accessed via <literal>SMAP</literal>.</para>

      <note>
	<para>
Not all types of mail accounts support every message status flag.
Unsupported message status flags will be automatically emulated,
where possible.
Specifically, POP3 mail accounts do not have a concept of message
status flags at all.
Each time a POP3 mail account is opened, the status of all messages in the
POP3 account will be reset to the default status (unread message, no other
flags set).</para>
