  <title>Mail Filters</title>

    <para>
This is a simple, automatic mail processing function.
In this context, <quote>mail filtering</quote> means the ability to move,
automatically delete, or automatically flag all messages that match
a specific search criteria.</para>

    <para>
Where possible, it is always more efficient to have the mail server filter
messages, instead of a mail client like &app;.
&app; mail filters may prove to be sufficient
if the mail server does not mail filtering abilities.
In situations where the mail server is capable of filtering, the mail server's
filters will usually be faster and more efficient.</para>

    <para>
Mail filters may be used with any IMAP, <link linkend="smap1">SMAP</link>,
or a local mail account.
Mail filters may also be used with POP3 accounts, but they'll be slow,
and they'll have certain limitations.
&app; will have to download a copy of every message in the POP3 mailbox, in
order to check it against the searching criteria, for every mail filter
search.  This is not needed with IMAP/SMAP accounts, where the search
request is processed by the mail server.</para>

    <para>
Mail filters may also be used in limited ways with Usenet newsgroups.
Only limited forms of searching are available: only Usenet message headers
may be searched, and the searching criteria may only include English
characters.  All other search requests can only be met by downloading a copy
of every message from the newsgroup, which is not going to work very well,
for obvious reasons.</para>

    <para>
The best use for mail filters with a Usenet newsgroup is as a simple
killfile:
<quote>Search From: contains troll@example.com</quote>,
followed by <quote>Delete and Expunge</quote>.</para>

    <para>
A mail filter may be installed for any folder.
Each folder has its own mail filters.
The folder's mail filter is automatically processed by &app; whenever:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
The folder is opened for the first time, or reopened after another folder
was opened.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
New messages are added to the folder.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
All messages in the folder are processed by the mail filters when the
folder is opened.
When new messages are added to the folder, only the new messages will be
processed by the mail filters.
Existing messages will be ignored.</para>

    <para>
This screen is accessed by highlighting a folder on the Folder Listing
screen, then pressing <keycap>F</keycap>.
Each mail filter consists of one or more <quote>steps</quote>.
There are two kinds of steps:
a <quote>select</quote>
step compiles a list of messages that match a certain search
criteria; the selection step is followed by one or more steps that
apply a particular <quote>action</quote> against all messages that were
selected.
More than one action step may follow a selection step; messages are processed
by each action step in sequence, until another selection step, which searches
the remaining messages again, and compiles a different list of selected
messages.</para>

      <para>
Some actions cannot be naturally followed by any other action, and can only
be followed by another selection step.
Consider, for example,
<quote>Delete And Expunge</quote> or <quote>Move to
another folder</quote> filtering step:
at the conclusion the selected messages are obviously removed,
and nothing else can be done with them, any more.</para>

    <para>
This screen initially shows any existing filtering steps defined for the
folder.
All filtering steps are processed in the order shown.
Highlighting an existing filtering step and pressing
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>U</keycap>, or
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap>, moves the filtering step higher
or lower, thus changing its relative order in the mail filter.
<keycap>DEL</keycap> removes the existing filtering step.
The folder's mail filter is removed by highlighting each step and pressing
<keycap>DEL</keycap>, then highlighting <quote>Save Filters</quote> and
pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.</para>

      <para>
All changes made on this screen are temporary.
<quote>Save Filters</quote>
must be selected in order for any changes made on this screen to take
effect.
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>C</keycap> closes this screen without changing
the folder's existing filter, throwing out all the temporary changes.</para>

      <para>
Highlighting
<quote>Add new filter</quote> and pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap> adds a new
filtering step to the end of the mail filter.
A sub-menu is shown to define the new filtering step:</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>S</keycap> - select</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Enters a new searching criteria which will be used to select messages for
the following action steps.
See <quote>Search criteria</quote>, below, for more
information.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>D</keycap> - mark deleted</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Marks all selected messages as deleted.
The messages are not removed from the folder, but only marked as
deleted.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>U</keycap> - unmark deleted</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Removes the <quote>deleted</quote> mark from the selected messages.
The selected messages are no longer marked as deleted.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>X</keycap> - delete and expunge</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
The selected messages are removed from the folder.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>R</keycap> - mark each message as tagged</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Marks, or highlights the
selected messages on the folder index screen.
Tagged messages are shown as highlighted on the folder index screen,
preceded by
<quote><literal>*</literal></quote>.
On some displays, tagged messages are flagged by a checkmark symbol
instead of the
<quote><literal>*</literal></quote>.</para>

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>K</keycap> - unmark, or untag the messages</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Removes the highlighting mark from the selected messages.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>W</keycap> - watch thread</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Watch the selected message's replies/subthreads (unless the message is
already a part of a watched thread).
See <link linkend="watch"><quote>Watching Threads</quote></link>
in the <quote>Folder Index</quote> chapter for more information
on thread watching.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>A</keycap> - unwatch thread</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Stops watching the message, and its replies/subthreads.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>M</keycap> - move messages</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Move the selected messages to another folder.
Selecting this option reopens the folder index screen.
Highlight the folder where the messages can be moved to,
and press ENTER.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>
Messages can be moved only to folders in the same mail account.
Messages cannot be moved to a folder in another mail account.</para>

	      <para>
This means that this option is not available with POP3 accounts, which
naturally have only one folder.</para>
	    </note>

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>C</keycap> - copy messages</term>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Copies the selected messages to another folder.
This is very similar to the move command, except copies of the selected
messages remain in the original folder.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>
This mail filter will be processed every time a folder is opened.
Therefore,
the selected messages will be copied to another folder every time this
folder is opened.
This Copy filtering step should be followed by another filtering step,
such as Move, or Delete/Expunge, that removes all selected messages.
Otherwise the results could be quite amusing</para>
