Most IMAP servers have restrictions on which combinations of access rights
are valid for which folders.
See the IMAP server's documentation to check for any access rights
restrictions.
The most common restriction is that the
<quote>e</quote>,
<quote>t</quote>, and
<quote>x</quote>
access rights must either be set together, as a group, or not.
The server will reject or ignore an attempt to set prohibited combinations
of access rights for a given folder.</para>

      <para>
Some IMAP servers implement an extended form of the access control list
protocol which makes it possible to obtain the server's restrictions.
When an attempt to set an invalid access right combination is rejected,
<replaceable>errorIdentifier</replaceable> will be set to indicate which
identifier's access right combination was rejected (usually it will be
set to the same value as <replaceable>identifier</replaceable>.</para>

      <para>
<replaceable>errorRights</replaceable> will be set to an array of strings,
each strings consisting of one or more access rights.
The first array element, <replaceable>errorRights</replaceable>[0] will
contain the minimum access rights required for this folder
(which may be an empty string if the folder does not require any
minimum access rights for the identifier).
Each remaining string lists an optional access right allowed for this folder.
If a string contains more than one access right, it means that these
access rights must be added or removed from the access control list together,
as a group.</para>
