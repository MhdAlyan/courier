&gt; This patch puts the user lookups into their own functions. Means that
&gt; the config files are only read if the user is not found be an earlier
&gt; lookup. It would also make it easier to add support to control the
&gt; type/order of lookups at runtime, rather than always looking for the
&gt; search modules in their built-in order.

<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>W</keycap>,
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>Y</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>SPACE</keycap>
marks the starting position of a range of text.
To delete a block of text: move the cursor
to the beginning of the block of text,
press <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>SPACE</keycap>,
move the cursor to the end of text, press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>W</keycap>.
To re-insert this text someplace else, move the cursor to the insertion point
and press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>Y</keycap> (yank).</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>C</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Cancel composition of the current message.
Everything is thrown away, and this screen is closed.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Starts the spell checker (dictionary lookup).
Text starting with the cursor position, and until the end of the message,
is spell-checked.
Words that are not found in the dictionary are highlighted, and the status
line lists up to ten suggested replacement words.
To replace the highlighted word with one of the suggestions, press the number
corresponding to the suggested replacement, or:
press <keycap>I</keycap> to ignore this occurence of the misspelled word;
press <keycap>A</keycap> to ignore all occurencer of the misspelled word,
press <keycap>R</keycap> to replace the misspelled word with a manually-entered
replacement.</para>

	  <para>
Note: quoted text
in replies (lines that begin with the <quote>&gt;</quote> character),
are not spell-checked.</para>
	</listitem>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>F</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Turn display of full headers on/off.
Initially, only the <quote>To:</quote>, <quote>Cc:</quote>, and
<quote>Subject:</quote> headers are shown.
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>F</keycap> shows additional headers:
<quote>From:</quote>, <quote>Reply-To:</quote>, <quote>Bcc:</quote>,
and <quote>Fcc:</quote>.</para>

	  <para>
The <quote>Fcc:</quote> header specifies the folder where a copy of the
message is saved, after it's sent.
One of the defined <quote>Sent Mail</quote> special folders is listed in
this header.  Highlight this header with the cursor, and press
<keycap>ENTER</keycap> to cycle through the list of available
<quote>Sent Mail</quote> special folders.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>G</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
This key (<quote>get</quote>) inserts a file into the current text document,
at the current cursor position.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Re-justifies the current paragraph.
&app; uses <quote>lazy</quote> word-wrapping.
&app; word-wraps long lines when new text is being added; however when
deleting text short lines are not re-wrapped.
Pressing this key re-formats the current paragraph to the optimal line length,
taking into account all previous editing.</para>

	  <para>
&app; will not re-justify quoted text in replies.
Remove the leading quote characters, <quote>&gt;</quote>, justify, then
re-insert the quote characters, if necessary.</para>

	  <para>
Technical note: messages composed in &app; are marked as
<quote>flowed-text</quote>
MIME plain text.
This format uses invisible trailing whitespace to tag paragraph breaks.
Mail readers that support <quote>flowed-text</quote> format (of which
&app; is one), are capable of automatically reformatting flowed text into
a variable-width display.
When composing new text, &app; automatically inserts the appropriate
invisible whitespace characters, as needed.
Extensive editing may inadvertently delete the flowed-text
<quote>watermarks</quote>, resulting in a line, or two, not wrapping properly
on the expected margin break.
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap> reformats the current paragraph,
and makes sure that everything is in proper order, automatically restoring
any deleted flowed-text trailing whitespace.</para>

	  <para>
Liberal use of <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap> during editing is
highly encouraged.
Not only does this make written text look good, it makes new text look
extra-good, in modern mail clients that know how to read flowed-text formatted
messages.</para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>K</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Delete text between the current cursor position, and the end of the
line.</para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>S</keycap>,
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>R</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Search for a text string starting at the current cursor position,
or search and replace text.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>N</keycap></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Define a new macro.
First, define a text range using
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>SPACE</keycap> and cursor keys.
With the text range highlighted, press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>N</keycap>, type in a short abbreviation,
then press <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.</para>

	    <para>
The text range will be memorized, and from this point on, typing the
abbreviation will automatically insert the memorized range.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>
The abbreviation cannot contain spaces or tabs (the text range itself
may contain anything, only the abbreviation cannot have spaces).</para>

	      <para>
The memorized text range is inserted verbatim, without reformatting.
If memorized text is inserted in a middle of a
line, it may be necessary to use <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap>
to re-justify the text.</para>
	    </note>

	    <para>
If the keyboard has function keys, it is possible to press a
function key instead of entering an abbreviation; and use the
same function key
to insert the memorized text.</para>

	    <note>
	      <para>
Not all function keys may be available in every situation.
<application>gnome-terminal</application>, for example, appropriates
<keycap>F1</keycap> for its own online help pages; so
<keycap>F1</keycap> is not available to applications running in a
<application>gnome-terminal</application> window.</para>
	    </note>

	    <para>
To re-define a macro, highlight another text range, press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>N</keycap>, then enter the same abbreviation,
or press the same function key.</para>

	    <para>
Macros can be deleted from the main setup screen in &app;.</para>
	  </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>T</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Highlight the <quote>Attachments:</quote> header and press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>T</keycap> to create an attachment by picking
a file from an interactive dialog that shows all files in the current
directory.
Move the cursor to highlight a subdirectory, or the parent directory, and
press <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to switch to a different directory.
Highlight a file to read the file and attach it to the current message.</para>

	  <para>
The attachment filename may also be typed directly into the file selection
dialog.
The attachment filename, relative to the home directory,
may also be typed directly into the <quote>Attachments:</quote> header,
instead of pressing <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>T</keycap>.</para>

	    <para>
On most systems it is possible to attach multiple files at the same time
by entering a filename pattern, such as <quote>*.txt</quote> - which selects
all files that end in <quote>.txt</quote>.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>U</keycap></term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Runs an external editor application, to edit the contents of this message.
An external editor must be previously configured by choosing the
<quote>Setup</quote> selection from &app;'s main menu.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>X</keycap></term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
When all is said and done, <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>X</keycap> sends
the message.
One, final chance, is offered to cancel, and change one's mind.
If the mail server supports
<ulink url="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1891.txt">Delivery
Status Notifications</ulink>, press <keycap>D</keycap> to select
delivery notifications options.
Where available, press <keycap>E</keycap> to encrypt the message, and/or
press <keycap>S</keycap> to sign the message, using
<application>GnuPG</application>.</para>

	    <para>
Encryption/signing options, if available, must be selected before setting
any delivery status notification options.</para>
