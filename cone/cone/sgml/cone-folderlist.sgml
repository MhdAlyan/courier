  <title>Folder Listing</title>
  <para>
This is the first screen that comes up after starting &app;.
This screen lists all configured mail accounts.
After starting, &app; automatically opens the first configured mail account,
prompting for a password if necessary.
&app; is capable of handling multiple mail accounts, and
any additional configured mail accounts are initially closed.
To open one of the other mail account, highlight it with the cursor and
press <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.</para>

  <para>
When a mail account is opened, &app; lists the default set of folders
in the mail account.
Folders that contain other subfolders, instead of messages, are prefixed
by a <quote><literal>+</literal></quote>, or a
<quote><literal>&rarr;</literal></quote>
(depending on the display).
Certain mail servers may have folders that contain both messages and
subfolders.
Those so-called <quote>hybrid</quote> folders are prefixed
by a <quote><literal>*</literal></quote>, or a
<quote><literal>&bull;</literal></quote>
(depending on the display).</para>

  <para>
Move the cursor to highlight a folder and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap>
to display its contents (either an index of messages in the folder; or
a list of the folder's subfolders).
Use <keycap>+</keycap> to display subfolders of a hybrid folder,
use <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to display the index of messages in a hybrid
folder.</para>

  <para>
Move the cursor to highlight a folder with displayed subfolders and press
<keycap>-</keycap> to remove its subfolders from display.</para>

  <para>
Some mail accounts will display the number of messages in
each folder, automatically.
Sometimes the number of messages in a mail folder
cannot be quickly determined, so &app; will not bother to show the
folder's size.
Message counts are automatically shown for:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
Mail stored in local maildir folders.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
Mail stored on most remote POP3 and IMAP servers.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
Message counts are not automatically shown for:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
Mail stored in local mailbox files.</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
Mail stored on some IMAP servers.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
Sometimes &app; cannot correctly determine whether the IMAP server
provides message counts quickly.
Use the <quote><literal>/slowstatus</literal></quote> or the
<quote><literal>/faststatus</literal></quote> flag when creating the new mail
account to specify whether &app; should automatically show message counts
for displayed folders.</para>

  <para>
When &app; runs for the very first time, &app; creates a mail account
that contains local mail folders.
Use the main menu screen to add additional mail accounts.
Here's an example of the <quote>Folder Listing</quote> screen:</para>

</programlisting>

    <para>
The bottom two lines of the screen lists the available <quote>hotkeys</quote>,
and their corresponding actions.
<quote><literal>^</literal></quote> indicates that <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
should be held down while pressing the following key.
On this screen, for example, press and hold <keycap>CTRL</keycap>,
then press and release <keycap>D</keycap> to invoke the
<quote>Move down</quote> action (described below).</para>

    <para>
Screens with more <quote>hotkeys</quote> that can fit on the screen will
use <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>O</keycap> to cycle through the complete
<quote>hotkey</quote> listing.</para>

    <para>
As shown in the illustration above, &app; lists the hierarchy of available
folders in a natural, tree-like format.
The list of folders in each mail account begins with a list called
<quote>top-level folders</quote>; the 
<keycap>ENTER</keycap> and <keycap>+</keycap>
keys will then display the contents of each folder.</para>

    <para>
When a new mail account is configured, &app; creates a default list of
<quote>top-level folders</quote>, as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
	<term>Local mail folders</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The default top-level folder list initially contains one entry, the name
of the directory where local mail folders are kept, and a second, optional
entry that represents the default system mailbox.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Local maildirs</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The default top-level folder list initially contains two entries:
<quote>INBOX</quote> - messages; and
<quote>Folders</quote> - folders
(&app; implements the <quote>Maildir++</quote> folder extension, as
implemented by the <ulink url="http://www.courier-mta.org"><application>Courier
Mail Server</application></ulink>).</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>POP3 mailboxes</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
A POP3 mailbox does not contain any folders.
When opened, a POP3 mail account displays the number of messages in
the POP3 mailbox where the top-level folder list is usually shown.
Highlighting it and pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap> will display the
index of messages in the POP3 mailbox.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>IMAP accounts</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The default top-level folder list initially contains
<quote>INBOX</quote> (the default IMAP new mail folder), and any other
default mail folder hierarchies, as announced by the IMAP server.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>SMAP accounts</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The default top-level folder list is initialized by downloading the
default folder list from the SMAP server.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>NetNews (Usenet) accounts</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
The default top-level folder list contains
four entries, described below.</para>

      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

      <section>
	<title>Reading Usenet Newsgroups</title>

	<para>
Opening a NetNews (Usenet) account displays four entries:</para>

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>All Newsgroups</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
This entry opens a hierarchical listing of all available newsgroups,
subscribed and unsubscribed.
Highlight a newsgroup with the cursor and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to
subscribe and open the newsgroup for the first time.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Check for new newsgroups</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
This entry opens a list of all recently created newsgroups.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Refresh newsgroup list</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Highlight this entry with the cursor and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to
download and save the server's entire list of available newsgroups.
This process may take a long time.
On low bandwidth connections it may take 15-20 minutes, depending on the
number of newsgroups carried by the server.</para>

	      <para>
Sometimes servers may not correctly report newly-created newsgroups,
so using this option will be necessary in order to add the new groups to
"All newsgroups".
Additionally, this is the only way to remove newsgroups no longer carried
by the server from "All newsgroups".</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Subscribed newsgroups</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
This entry contains a list of subscribed newsgroups.
To subscribe to a newsgroup, find it under "All newsgroups" and open it.
This action automatically subscribes the newsgroup.
To unsubscribe a newsgroup, highlight it here, then press
<keycap>D</keycap> (Delete).</para>

	      <para>
Another way to subscribe to a newsgroup is described in the following
section.</para>

	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>
      </section>
    <section>
      <title>Adding top-level folders</title>

      <para>
There are two ways to manually insert additional folders into the top-level
list.
The easiest way is to highlight an existing folder, then press
<keycap>U</keycap>, then <keycap>T</keycap>.
This folder is now included in the top-level folder list.
It is important to note that the actual mail folder is not renamed, or
otherwise moved in the mail account, it is only shown as part of the
default top-level folder hierarchy.
The top-level entry for this folder can be thought of as a
<quote>shortcut</quote> to the folder.
If the original folder is located deep in the mail account's folder hierarchy,
it is no longer necessary to dive deep into the hierarchy each time the
mail account is opened, in order to reach the folder; it's going to be
right there, in the top-level folder hierarchy.</para>

      <para>
Top-level folders do no appear in their original location in the mail
account's folder hierarchy.
When the folder is first added to the top-level folder list it momentarily
appears twice: in its actual location, on the screen, and at the topmost
level.
After its original hierarchy folder level is closed, it will no longer
appear.
As noted above, the folder is still there, it just appears as a shortcut
at the topmost level.
When the shortcut is removed (see the next section), the folder reappears
in its place.</para>

      <para>
The second way to create top-level folder shortcuts is to highlight the name
of the mail account with the cursor, then press
<keycap>A</keycap> (Add).
&app; shows the following prompt:
<quote><literal>Add folder/directory in</literal>
<replaceable>account</replaceable></quote>.
Enter the complete folder name, as used by the mail account's server.
This method for adding top-level folders requires some knowledge of the
folder's location on the mail server.
However it can be used to add folders
that are outside of the currently-configured folder hierarchies
(which is sometimes the case with IMAP servers), as follows:</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>IMAP folders</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
The folder name is used as is.
This means that folders whose names contain characters that are not in
the application's character set, or do not follow the IMAP modified
<literal>UTF-7</literal>
folder name encoding, cannot be entered.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>SMAP folders</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Specify the complete folder path name.
Use the forward slash character,
<quote><literal>/</literal></quote> to separate
names of individual folders in the <literal>SMAP</literal> folder hierarchy.
Unicode/ISO-10646 characters that cannot be represented in the application's
character set may be specified as
<quote><literal>%</literal><replaceable>n</replaceable><literal>;</literal></quote>,
where <replaceable>n</replaceable> is a decimal Unicode value.
Use <quote><literal>\/</literal></quote> to specify a forward slash character
in the folder name, <quote><literal>\\</literal></quote> to specify
a backslash character, and <quote><literal>\%</literal></quote> to specify
the <quote>%</quote> character.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Usenet (NetNews) newsgroups</term>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Usenet accounts already have a dedicated link to subscribed newsgroups.
For Usenet accounts, this process is used to subscribe to a new newsgroup
which does not appear under "All newsgroups".</para>

	      <para>
It is not possible for NetNews (Usenet) readers to maintain a correct,
accurate list of available newsgroups.
Usenet readers must download a list of available newsgroups, which can be
quite large and require a significant time to download.
It's not feasible to do this every time.
As such, Usenet readers keep a saved copy of the download newsgroup list.
Upon request, the newsgroup list may be downloaded again, and the locally
saved list is brought up to date.
This is what "Refresh newsgroup list" does.</para>

	      <para>
"Check for new newsgroups" is a partial solution that's supported by most
Usenet news servers, and can usually do the trick and download recently
added newsgroups.
There's no way to remove newsgroups no longer carried by the server, except
by using "Refresh newsgroup list", but at least "Check for new newsgroups"
will do the trick and include new groups under "All newsgroups", so that they
can be subscribed to.</para>

	      <para>
However, sometimes "Refresh newsgroup list" might not work with some oddball
news server, or the news server can accidentally lose its wits and "forget"
which new newsgroups were added, recently.
In any case, use
the process for creating a top-level folder in order to manually subscribe
to a newsgroup.
Type in the newsgroup's name, carefully checking for the correct spelling.
After creating a link, open it and the newsgroup will now be subscribed to,
and it will now appear under "Subscribed newsgroups".</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>Local mbox-type mail folders and maildirs</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
Specify the complete folder path name, relative to main folder directory.
For example, if this mail account is configured as a local mbox mail account
in <filename>$HOME/Mail</filename>, use
<quote><literal>foo/bar</literal></quote> to specify
<filename>$HOME/Mail/foo/bar</filename>.
Use the forward slash character,
<quote><literal>/</literal></quote> to separate
names of individual folders in the local mail folder hierarchy.
The actual folder names use the modified <literal>UTF-7</literal> character
set, and the entered folder name is automatically converted from the
application's character set to modified <literal>UTF-7</literal>.
This is needed for compatibility reasons (making it possible to access
local mail folders both directly, and using IMAP or SMAP).</para>

	    <para>
Unicode/ISO-10646 characters that cannot be represented in the application's
character set may be specified as
<quote><literal>%</literal><replaceable>n</replaceable><literal>;</literal></quote>,
where <replaceable>n</replaceable> is a decimal Unicode value.
Use <quote><literal>\\</literal></quote> to specify
a backslash character, and <quote><literal>\%</literal></quote> to specify
the <quote>%</quote> character.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Removing top-level folders</title>

      <para>
Highlight a top-level folder with the cursor, and press
<keycap>D</keycap> to remove it.
The folder is not actually deleted from the mail account, it is only removed
from its top-level placement, and it will now appear in its real location
in the mail account's folder hierarchy.</para>
    </section>

      <section>
	<title>Removing memorized headers</title>

	<para>
&app; memorizes custom mail headers in sent messages.
When replying to a message in a folder, or creating a new message when the
folder's contents are shown, the memorized content are used to set up the
initial default values of custom headers.
Different mail folders may have different defaults memorized.
Additionally, each mail account has a global set of memorized default headers,
which are used when replying or writing a message for the first time in a
new folder.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
At encryption key used for signing messages is handled just like a custom
header, and a different encryption key may be set as a default for each
folder.</para>
	</note>

	<para>
Highlight a folder and press <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>R</keycap> to
remove all memorized header defaults for the highlighted folder.
The initial header values for this folder
will now default to the global account defaults.</para>
      </section>

    <section>
      <title>Renaming folders</title>

      <para>
Highlight an existing mail folder and press <keycap>R</keycap> to
rename it.
This option does not work when a top-level folder is highlighted.
A top-level folder is, essentially, a shortcut to an existing folder.
Remove the top-level folder shortcut, find the original folder in its
regular position in the folder hierarchy, then rename it.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Creating new folders</title>

      <para>
To create a new folder, highlight its parent folder directory, then
press <keycap>A</keycap> (Add).
&app; responds with the following prompt:
<quote><literal>Create new folder in</literal>
<replaceable>parent</replaceable></quote>.
Enter the name of a new folder, and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.</para>

      <para>
Press
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap> before
<keycap>ENTER</keycap> in order to create a folder directory, instead of
a regular folder.
A folder directory contains other subfolders, instead of messages.
Some IMAP and SMAP mail servers can create so-called
<quote>hybrid</quote> folders -- folders that contain both messages and
other subfolders.
Repeat this process twice to create a hybrid folder.
Enter the same name both times; first to create a folder, then a folder
directory with the same name.</para>

      <para>
Local mbox-type mail accounts cannot have hybrid folders.
Hybrid folders are available with local maildir accounts.</para>

      <para>
Do not create a folder directory without creating at least one subfolder
immediately afterwards.
When a parent directory is shown,
some mail accounts may not display a folder directory that does not have
at least one subfolder.
For best results:
after creating a new folder directory, make sure that its name is highlighted,
then use this command to create its first subfolder.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Deleting folders</title>

      <para>
Highlight the name of a folder with a cursor then press
<keycap>D</keycap> (Delete) to remove it.
The folder, and its contents, will be deleted.
Use the same process to remove a folder directory.
When trying to remove a hybrid folder, &app; will prompt to choose to
remove either the subfolders, or the messages in the hybrid folder.</para>

      <para>
Some mail accounts may require that all messages in a folder be
manually removed first, and will not remove a folder until it's completely
empty.</para>

      <para>
Some mail accounts may require that all subfolders in a folder directory be
manually removed first, and will not remove a folder
directory until it's completely
empty.</para>

      <para>
Note: highlighting a top-level folder and pressing <keycap>D</keycap> removes
only the top-level shortcut, and does not remove the actual folder.</para>

    </section>

      <section>
	<title>Editing folder permissions</title>

	<para>
Highlight a folder, then press <keycap>P</keycap> to view or edit folder
permissions.
Folder permissions determine whether other IMAP mail accounts may view, or
change the contents of the folder.
This option is only available for folders on IMAP mail servers that
implement access control lists (access control lists are
an optional IMAP protocol feature that is implemented by many IMAP servers).
Attempting to use this option on a folder that's not an IMAP folder, or
if the IMAP server does not implement access control lists, will result
in an error.</para>

	<para>
Pressing <keycap>P</keycap> shows a submenu with two options:</para>

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>View permissions</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Press <keycap>V</keycap> to display
your permissions are on the given folder.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	  <varlistentry>
	    <term>Edit permissions</term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Press <keycap>E</keycap> to display all permissions for the given folder;
this option may also be used to modify or adjust them.</para>

	      <para>
This option is available only if <quote>View permissions</quote> shows that
you have the
<quote>Administrator</quote> permission for the folder.
Otherwise selecting this option results in an error.</para>

               <para>
The <quote>Edit permissions</quote> screen is designed to be self-explanatory.
Folder permissions, or <quote>access control list</quote> as its called,
consists of a list of identifier/rights pairs.
<quote>identifier</quote> designates the entity with the associated
rights.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

	&libmail-aclentities;

	<para>
Highlight an identifier with the cursor and press <keycap>Enter</keycap>
to modify the identifier's rights.
To delete an identifier, and its associated rights,
highlight it with the cursor and press <keycap>D</keycap>.
Press <keycap>A</keycap> to add an identifier.
Use the next submenu to select the new identifier
(<quote><literal>owner</literal></quote>,
<quote><literal>user</literal></quote>,
etc...), then specify the new identifier's rights.</para>

	<note>
          <para>
Not all servers support every kind of an access control list identifier.
Additionally, some IMAP servers are limited in the combination of access
rights that may be given to an identifier.
For example, IMAP servers that implement version 1 of the access control
list protocol can only assign the <quote>Delete/undelete messages</quote>,
<quote>Expunge deleted messages</quote>, and
<quote>Delete folder</quote> together as a group.
Either all three access rights must be given to an identifier, or none of
them.
An attempt to add only one or two of these access rights will be rejected
by the server.</para>

	  <para>
Other IMAP servers may have other restrictions on which combination of
access rights are valid, or not.
Depending on the server, the error message which rejects an invalid access
rights combination may or may not be informative.
Check the IMAP server's documentation for more information.</para>

	<title>Installing filters</title>

	<para>
Highlighting a folder and pressing <keycap>F</keycap> opens a screen where
the folder's filters may be entered or modified.
This is an advanced topic.
See <link linkend="cone12filters"><quote>Mail Filters</quote></link> for more

    <section>
      <title>Removing mail accounts</title>

      <para>
Highlight the mail account's name with the cursor, and press
<keycap>D</keycap> to remove it.
This action logs out and removes the mail account.
New mail accounts are added from the main menu.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Rearranging accounts and top-level folders</title>

      <para>
The order in which mail accounts, and their top-level folders, are listed
may be adjusted by highlighting a mail account, or a top-level folder,
and then using <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>U</keycap> or
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap>.</para>

      <para>
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>U</keycap> moves the highlighted mail account,
or folder, one position upwards,
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap> moves it one position
downwards.</para>

      <para>
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>U</keycap> and
<keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>D</keycap> only work when a mail account,
or a top-level folder, is highlighted.
Other folders are always shown in alphabetical order.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Defining special folders</title>

      <para>
&app; needs to assign folders for certain tasks.
Highlighting a folder, and pressing <keycap>U</keycap> (Use special)
brings up the following prompt, which designates the highlighted folder
as follows:</para>

      <variablelist>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>A</keycap> - address book</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
&app; can save its simple E-mail address book on a remote server, in
addition to its local address book.
POP3 mail folders cannot be used as remote address books, only IMAP or
SMAP folders can do that.
To create a new address book on a remote server, create a new IMAP or SMAP
folder, highlight it with a cursor, and use this option.</para>

	    <para>
This option adds a new remote address book.
&app; can handle more than one address book, and E-mail addresses are
looked up in each configured address book, sequentially, until the address
is found.</para>

	      <para>
&app; can also search LDAP server-based address books.
LDAP address books are added by choosing the <quote>Address Book</quote>
option from the Main Menu.</para>

	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term><keycap>D</keycap> - draft</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
The draft folder is where new,
unfinished messages, that have not been sent yet, are saved.
Only one draft folder may be defined;
selecting a new draft folder automatically unselects the previous draft
folder.</para>
	  </listitem>

      <para>
IMPORTANT: a POP3 folder cannot be used as a special folder.
Only IMAP, SMAP, or a local mail folder may be used as a special folder.</para>

      <para>
IMPORTANT: do not delete a mail folder, or a mail account, that contains a
special folder.
Remove an existing address book using the <quote>Address Book</quote>
selection from &app;'s main menu.
Remove an existing draft folder first by selecting a draft folder on a
different mail account.
Remove an existing sent-mail folder by choosing the <quote>Setup</quote>
selection from &app;'s main menu.
Then, the folder or the account containing a special folder
can be deleted.</para>

      <para>
IMPORTANT: Do not open an address book folder, or a remote configuration folder
manually, unless the remote IMAP/SMAP server allows concurrent access to the
same folder.
&app; opens and closes these folders automatically, when needed.
If the remote IMAP/SMAP server does not allow the same folder opened more than
once, opening the folder manually will result in unpredictable errors.</para>

      <para>
Use the cursor to highlight the name of a mail account, and press
<keycap>E</keycap> to edit the mail account's configuration.
This is primarily useful with remote mail accounts.
There isn't much to do with local mail accounts.
Just remove an existing local mail account, then add a new account that
points to a different mail folder directory.</para>

      <para>
More details about the process of configuring a mail account can be found in
the section that describes the process of adding a new mail account.</para>
