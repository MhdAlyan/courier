Pressing <keycap>W</keycap> opens the <quote>Write
Message</quote> screen.
This is the screen where a new message can be typed, and sent.
&app; checks for any unfinished messages in the Draft
folder, before opening this screen.
If the Draft folder contains any messages, &app;
offers an option to resume writing an unfinished message, instead of
starting a new message.
&app; automatically saves a backup copy of the current message being edited, at
regular intervals, so that a backup copy can be recovered in the event that
&app; is interrupted, or terminated, in a middle of editing a new message.
If a backup copy exists, &app; announces the existence of an interrupted
message, and prompts to resume writing the interrupted message.
An interrupted message must be opened and either: sent, explicitly cancelled, or
saved in the Draft folder; before another message can be written.</para>
