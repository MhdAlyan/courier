		<para>
Do not open the account unless the server supports secure password
authentication.
Secure password authentication verifies the account's password using
a challenge/response authentication
mechanism (where the label "<literal>cram</literal>" comes from).
The actual password is never actually transmitted to the server,
and therefore cannot be intercepted
while in transit over an untrusted network.</para>

		<para>
Secure password authentication is not supported by all servers.  This
option may not work with some servers.
This option does not enable secure password authentication, it only mandates
its use.
If the server supports secure password authentication, it will be used
even without the <literal>/cram</literal> option.
Traditional userid/password authentication will be used only if the
server does not implement secure password authentication.
The <literal>/cram</literal> option makes secure password authentication
mandatory.</para>

		<para>
The <literal>/cram</literal> option is marginally
useful even with encrypted server
connections.
The secure password authentication never sends the explicit
password to the server.
Encryption makes it theoretically impossible to recover the password from
an encrypted data connection; but with secure authentication the password
is never sent over the connection in the first place (the password's validity
is certified by exchanging certain mathematical calculations between the
server and the client).
If the server is compromised, the compromised server will not receive the
account password (unless the password is recovered from the server in other
ways).</para>
