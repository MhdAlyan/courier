    <title>Certificates</title>

    <para>
&app; can use <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificate authentication, in lieu of a
userid and a password, for logging into a <acronym>POP3</acronym> or an
<acronym>IMAP</acronym> mailbox, or for sending mail using authenticated SMTP,
if this functionality is supported by the server.</para>

    <para>
A master password must be set up before installing <acronym>SSL</acronym>
certificates.
See <xref linkend="cone09masterpassword" />.
Setting up <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificates
is a two-step process. First, the <acronym>SSL</acronym>
certificte must be imported into &app;. Then, the mail account is configured
to use <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificate authentication.</para>

    <para>
Pressing <keycap>C</keycap> from the main menu opens the certificate import
screen. Press <keycap>I</keycap> to import a certificate, then choose the
filename using the following dialogs.</para>

    <para>
The file with the <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificate must be a 
<acronym>PEM</acronym>-formatted certificate file that holds both the
certificate and the corresponding key. The file should have a
<quote><literal>BEGIN CERTIFICATE</literal></quote> section followed by a
<quote><literal>BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY</literal></quote> section
(or a <quote><literal>BEGIN DH PRIVATE KEY</literal></quote> section).
Passphrase-protected keys are not supported by &app;. If the SSL certificate
is signed by an intermediate certificate authority, the authority's certificate
should follow the private key section.</para>

    <para>
The certificate screen shows a list of all imported certificates.
A default name is initially given to an imported certificate, based on its
subject. Press <keycap>R</keycap> to rename a certificate.
Press <keycap>D</keycap> to delete a certificate.</para>

    <para>
Importing at least one certificate activates an account option for choosing
an <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificate. The new button appears on the
<link linkend="cone06newaccount">New Account</link> (and the Edit Account)
screen. The button also appears on the main
<link linkend="cone05setup">Setup</link> screen, below the
<acronym>SMTP</acronym> server's name.
Choosing the button pops up a list of imported <acronym>SSL</acronym>
certificates to choose from.</para>

    <section id="certrenewing">
      <title>Renewing <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificates</title>

      <para>
An additional prompt is issued when
importing a certificate with a name matching the name of one of the
existing certificates. Confirm the prompt to replace the existing certificate
with the new one. All accounts that use that certificate for authenticating
are automatically updated.</para>

      <para>
To effectively renew a certificate in this manner,
the new certificate's name must match
the name of an existing certificate, exactly.</para>
