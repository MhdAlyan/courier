  <title>Reading local mail with &app;</title>

  <para>
&app; reads local mail from either maildirs (the preferred format) or
mailbox files (or "mboxes").
When mboxes are used,
&app; does not read the system mailbox file directly (usually
<filename>/var/spool/<replaceable>something</replaceable></filename>).
All messages in the system mailbox are automatically moved to
<filename>$HOME/Inbox</filename>, which is then accessed as if it was the
system mailbox.
Starting &app; for the first time on an mbox-based system automatically
copies all existing mail from the system mailbox file
to <filename>$HOME/Inbox</filename>.</para>

  <para>
This is an intentional design choice.  Normal user application cannot
create new files in <filename>/var/spool</filename>; all they can do is
read the mailbox file from <filename>/var/spool</filename>.
Therefore, the only way to update the mailbox file is by
rewriting it from scratch (more or less).
While the mailbox file is in the process of being rewritten, if the &app;
process is interrupted, or killed, the resulted in a corrupted
system mailbox.
There are way to minimize this vulnerability, but it cannot be eliminated
completely.
Some Linux kernels use an <quote>OOM killer</quote>
that may terminate any process when
the system memory is low.
There is no way to completely prevent corrupted system
mailbox files on those
kernels.</para>

  <para>
&app; uses an alternative way of updating mboxes.
&app; updates mboxes by creating a new mbox file separately,
then replacing the original mbox file with the new version.
Unfortunately this cannot be done with the system mailbox file, because of
the restricted access rights on the system spool directory.
To solve this problem &app; automatically copies the system mailbox file
to <filename>$HOME/Inbox</filename>, each time the system mailbox file is
opened and whenever new mail is available.</para>
