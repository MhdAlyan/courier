      <title>USAGE</title>

      <para>
<command>leaf</command> is a simple console text file editor, with
paragraph word-wrapping and spell checking.
<command>leaf</command> is based on the text editor in the &app;
mail reader and composer.
<command>leaf</command> opens <replaceable>filename</replaceable>, positioning
the cursor on the first line, or line #<replaceable>n</replaceable>,
if specified.</para>

      <para>
This is not really the best editor for program sources.
<command>leaf</command> is meant to be used as a quick editor for writing
short notes and memos.
As text is typed, words will automatically flow to wrap within a typical
80-character terminal display, even on larger display (due to
<command>leaf</command>'s heritage as an editor for E-mail messages, which
are traditionally formatted to fit an 80-character display).
Word wrapping is "lazy": only long text lines are wrapped.
Short text lines are not folded together.
Individual paragraphs are separated by blank lines of text.
Press <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap> to optimally
rejustify the paragraph under the cursor.
The bottom two lines on the screen list which keys to press for other
functions.</para>

      <refsect2>
	<title>Flowed text</title>
	<para>
	  The <option>-f</option> option enables <quote>flowed text</quote>
	  formatting convention. Plain text files have no explicit means for
	  joining multiple lines into logical paragraph. Each line of text
	  is an individual line, and a blank line marks the end of a paragraph.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In a <quote>flowed text</quote> formatted file, each line in a
	  paragraph except the last one ends with a space character. This makes
	  no visual difference, it's just a marker that this line should be
	  merged with the next line. The last line in the paragraph does not
	  end in a space character.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The trailing space character is logically removed from each flowed
	  line, and all flowed lines are merged into a logical paragraph
	  that can be adjusted to any display width. It's important to note
	  that text written in non-ideographic languages, where individual
	  words are separated by spaces, will have two space characters at
	  the end of every line: the space character that separates the last
	  word on the line from the first word on the next line, and the
	  a second space character that marks the line as a flowed line.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Because the trailing space marking a flowed line is logically removed,
	  without the second space character there will not be a logical
	  space between the two words, and if the paragraph's width is adjusted
	  for display the two words may get combined together.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The <option>-f</option> option puts
	  <command>leaf</command> into flowed text mode, removing spaces
	  from each flowed line of text in an opened file.
	  A flowed line is marked on the screen with a "&lt;" character in the
	  right margin (or a small "next line" character on a UTF-8
	  display). When saving a file <command>leaf</command> automatically
	  adds a trailing space to each line that's marked as flowed.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The flowed text mode stays in effect for each file opened in
	  <command>leaf</command>. When opening another file, press
	  <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>F</keycap> to turn flowed mode on or
	  off for the next file. This change stays in effect until it gets
	  toggled again.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Pressing <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap> optimally
	  rejustifies the text in flowed text mode.
	  <command>leaf</command> heuristically determines the start and the
	  end of the paragraph, readjusts the width of the paragraph, and
	  marks each line as flowed, except the last paragraph line.
	  <command>leaf</command> uses a unicode-based algorithm for determining
	  whether the last character line needs a space character, in addition
	  to the flowed space marker.
	</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
	    <command>leaf</command> is frequently used to edit plain text
	    email message content. Because email messages assign some
	    semantical meaning to lines of text that start with spaces or
	    "&gt;" characters, <keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>J</keycap>
	    will not rejustify lines of text that begin with a "&gt;" or a
	    space. These lines will be considered paragraph boundaries, in
	    addition to blank lines.
	  </para>
	</note>

	<title>Spell checking</title>

    <para>
The <option>-d</option> option sets the name of the dictionary used for spell
checking (overriding the default spell checking dictionary set by the
<envar>DICTIONARY</envar> environment variable).
<option>+<replaceable>n</replaceable></option> sets the initial cursor
position to line #<replaceable>n</replaceable>.</para>
