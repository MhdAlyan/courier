  <para>
Highlighting a folder on the folder listing screen and pressing <keycap>ENTER</keycap>
shows an index of messages in the folder.
&app; shows the following information for each message:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
The message number, starting from 1 and counting upwards.
New messages (unread messages), are prefixed with by
<quote><literal>N</literal></quote>.
Messages marked for deletion are prefixed by
<quote><literal>D</literal></quote>.
On some terminals, new messages are prefixed by a little diamond symbol,
and messages are marked for deletion by a crosscheck symbol.
Messages that have been replied to are prefixed by
 <quote><literal>R</literal></quote>.</para>
	<para>
&app; can process groups of messages at once (for example: deleting or moving a group
of messages to another folder).
This is done by
<quote>flagging</quote> each message, individually, then executing the command.
Each flagged message is marked with an asterisk,
<quote><literal>*</literal></quote>.
On some displays, flagged messages are identified by a checkmark symbol,
instead of the asterisk.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The date or time when the message was sent or received.  Only the date is shown for
messages sent or received over a week ago.
More recent messages have their day and time shown.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The sender's or recipient's name.
Messages sent to multiple people have only the first recipient shown.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The approximate size of the message.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
The message's subject.
There's not a lot of room to show the message's subject; &app; shows as
much of a subject as possible.</para>

	<para>
Messages that belong to a watched thread, or a subthread, have
the
<quote><literal>&equiv;</literal></quote>
<quote><literal>&bull;</literal></quote>
character shown, in reverse colors,
in front of the message's subject.
Terminals that cannot display these symbols will use the
<quote>o</quote> and <quote>*</quote> characters instead.
See <link linkend="watch"><quote>Watching Threads</quote></link>, below, for
more information.</para>

The highlighted message on this screen marks the current message.
Move the cursor using
the cursor up/down keys, <keycap>PgUp</keycap>, and <keycap>PgDn</keycap>.
The cursor left/right keys move the cursor to the previous/next
flagged message.
After running a search with the <keycap>;</keycap> command (see below),
use the cursor left/right keys to locate the messages found by
the search.</para>

Change the order the messages are shown on this screen.
Initially, the messages are shown in the order they were added to the folder.
Use this option to set the available sorting order:
<keycap>A</keycap> - in the order they were added to the folder (default);
<keycap>D</keycap> - order by each message's sent date;
<keycap>N</keycap> - order messages by sender's (or the recipient's) name;
<keycap>S</keycap> - order messages by their subject;
<keycap>T</keycap> - order messages by threads.</para>

	    <para>
The threaded view works best on UTF-8 consoles. It is also not very well suited
for machines with limited resources.
Computing a threaded view is expensive, and the threaded view needs to
be recomputed whenever messages are added or
removed from the folder.
Machines with limited resources should use a subject-based sort, which
is much faster, and gives similar results.</para>

<keycap>T</keycap> opens a submenu where a message may be
<quote>tagged</quote>.
Tagged messages are shown with a different background color.
This is merely a visual aid for highlighting selected messages, and
nothing more.
A color-capable display is necessary for showing tagged messages.</para>

	    <para>
The submenu lists nine available tags, selected by pressing a digit
<keycap>1</keycap> through <keycap>9</keycap>.
<keycap>0</keycap> removes the existing tag on the current message.
The colors for the tags are selected from those available on the current
display.
Some tags will share the same color if the current display has less than
nine available colors, in addition to the default text color.</para>

	    <para>
The names of each tag may be set by choosing the <quote>Setup</quote>
selection from &app;'s main menu.
The default names of the first five tags are the same as message labels
used by the Mozilla mail client.
With most IMAP servers &app; and Mozilla will see each other's tagged/labeled
messages (however &app;'s colors are determined by the console's color
palette, and may not necessary match the ones Mozilla
uses for the same label).
This requires additional IMAP server functionality that may not be implemented
by some IMAP servers.</para>

      <title>External commands</title>

      <para>
	An external command is any arbitrary command that &app; runs as a child
	process. The external command reads a copy of an email message
	on its standard input. The external command may take any arbitrary
	action with this email message, &app; doesn't care. This is a mechanism
	for integrating &app; with some custom mail processing code.
	&app; takes care of downloading an email message from a mailbox, and
	delivers it to an external command.
      </para>

      <note>
	<para>
	  The external command must consume and read the email message from
	  its standard input. If &app; detects that
	  the external command did not read the entire message before it
	  terminates, &app; assumes that the external command crashed, and
	  reports an error. Note that the message is sent via a pipe, and &app;
	  may not reliably detect a premature external command termination when
	  the email message is small and fits into the internal pipe buffer.
	</para>
      </note>

      <para>
	An external command may be assigned to any available keyboard function
	key.
	Different commands may be assigned to different function keys.
	Press <keycap>E</keycap> then a function key. If the function key
	is already assigned to an external command, &app; asks for a
	confirmation to remove the existing assignment.
	Otherwise, &app; asks for a short 1-2 word command name. This is
	a descriptive label that gets shown at the bottom of the screen, next
	to the function key name, together with all other
	<quote>hotkeys</quote>. Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> after typing in
	the label, then type out the external command. &app; passes the entered
	command, verbatim, to the system shell to execute.
      </para>

      <note>
	<para>
	  Some environments and desktops may reserve certain function keys for
	  their own use. The <application>Gnome</application> desktop, for
	  example, uses <keycap>F1</keycap> as an application help function.
	  Reserved function keys are not available to &app;, however there's
	  no way for &app; to know whether or not a given function key is
	  available for its use. When &app; may be used in multiple environments
	  or desktops, care should be taken to assign external commands to
	  function keys that are available in all environments.
	</para>
      </note>

      <para>
	&app; expects the external command to read its email message from
	standard input, finish up whatever it does with this message, and
	promptly terminate. &app; stops and waits for the external command to
	terminate, before it proceeds. &app; stops responding to any
	user input until the external command terminates.
	However, &app; still remains in control of the display.
	The external command should have its standard output and standard
	error redirected, otherwise its output will corrupt the terminal
	display.

	<title>Searching messages</title>

	<para>
Pressing <keycap>;</keycap> on the folder index screen brings up an extensive
sequence of options to enter a criteria that's used to search messages.
After the search criteria is specified, messages that meet the search
criteria are shown as flagged (highlighted, and preceded by
a
<quote><literal>*</literal></quote> or a checkmark).
Messages that meet the search criteria can be quickly located by
pressing the cursor left/right keys,
which move the cursor to the previous or the
next flagged message.</para>

	<para>
Requesting a search when some messages are already flagged shows an additional
prompt:</para>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
Searches the remaining messages that are not already flagged.
Any messages that meet the search criteria are also flagged.
Existing messages that are already flagged remain flagged.
The final result is that messages which meet both the new search criteria
and the previous search criteria(s) are flagged.</para>

	<title>Watching Threads</title>

	<para>
Pressing <keycap>A</keycap> displays the following prompt:
<quote>Watch thread up to <replaceable>A</replaceable> days,
<replaceable>B</replaceable>-deep replies? (Y/N).</quote>
The initial values for <replaceable>A</replaceable> and
<replaceable>B</replaceable> are taken from the setup screen.
Press <keycap>D</keycap> or <keycap>R</keycap> to adjust the defaults, if
desired.</para>

	<para>
Answering the prompt with <keycap>Y</keycap> will <quote>watch</quote> the
currently highlighted message, and any new replies to it.
The highlighted message's subject will be shown with a highly-visible
<quote><literal>&equiv;</literal></quote>
character (or the <quote>o</quote> character on some terminals).
New replies to the watched message will also be automatically marked in the
same fashion.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
Any existing replies to the watched message are not automatically marked.
Only future replies to the message will be automatically marked for
watching.</para>
	</note>

	<para>
Thread-watching is mostly useful with large NetNews newsgroups.
A single, watched,
conversation thread can be easily identified even in a very
active newsgroup; however thread-watching can also be used with regular
mail folders (with some limitations as noted below).</para>

	<para>
NetNews threads are famous for quickly diverging off-topic, so &app;'s
thread-watching future quietly turns itself off, after a while.
There's very little uses in continuing to monitor a thread that began
talking about the merits of organic food, but then ended up becoming a heated
discussion about psychological problems of the Hollywood elite.</para>

	<para>
The initial default settings will
watch for replies for up to fourteen days, or five levels
of follow-ups, whichever comes first.
That meaning that a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply to a reply
of a watched
message will still be shown as part of a watched thread, but its own reply
will not be.
There is no limit on the number of watched replies to the initial message,
or to any of the five subsequent
levels of follow-ups, as long as they arrive within
the time-enforced limit.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
After coming back from a 15-day vacation, and opening a folder which used to
have watched threads, none of the new messages will be marked for watching,
even though they arrived before the 14-days were up.
Well, you just had a nice 15-day vacation, why do you care about some stale
flame war that started more than two weeks ago?</para>
</note>

	<para>
The last level of watched followups will be marked with a different
character, a
<quote><literal>&bull;</literal></quote>
(or <quote><literal>*</literal></quote> as shown by some terminals), instead
of the
<quote><literal>&equiv;</literal></quote>
character.
This is a visual cue to evaluate whether this subthread is still worth
following.
If so, the message can be manually re-watched.
Highlighting the message and choosing this option will <quote>renew</quote>
the interest in this thread for another round of followups
(however other branches of the original thread will still expire as usual,
unless they are also renewed).</para>

	<para>
Selecting this option again on a message that's already being watched will
prompt to turn off watching for more replies.
The message will no longer appear watched, and any future replies
to the message will not be watched.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>
Any existing replies that are watched will continue to be watched, even
though the original message is no longer being watched.</para>
	</note>

	<section>
	  <title>Watching E-mail threads</title>

	  <para>
Thread watching is designed primarily to be used with NetNews newsgroups.
The mechanism by which replies are selected for watching is quick, and simple.
NetNews messages typically carry robust threading metadata,
and even if there's a NetNews hiccup, and messages come in out of order,
all eligible replies should
still be correctly selected for watching.
There is a very small chance that a very severe NetNews
disruption will result in a failure to catch watched
replies.
However, messages would probably come in so wildly out of sequence that the
thread is not likely to remain readable even if all watched replies were
properly tagged, whenever they arrive.</para>

	  <para>
Thread watching is not limited to NetNews newsgroups.
E-mail threads may also be selected for watching.
However, E-mail messages tend to have far less threading metadata than their
NetNews counterparts.
A disruption in incoming E-mail is more likely to result in missed replies,
than a NetNews disruption.
However, E-mail disruptions, on average, tend to occur far less often than
NetNews disruptions, so everything tends to come out even.</para>

	  <para>
Additionally, many modern E-mail clients now include the same
full threading metadata as NetNews clients (&app; always includes complete
threading metadata with every outgoing message, NetNews or E-mail).
This issue continues to be less and less relevant,
as time goes on.</para>
	</section>

      </section>

    <section>
      <title>Checking for new mail</title>

      <para>
The semantics of checking for new mail varies slightly, depending on the
mail account.
With SMAP-based mail account, and with most IMAP mail accounts, new mail in
the current folder is shown immediately.
If messages in the folder are shown in the order they were added to the folder,
new mail will naturally appear at the end of folder.
If messages are shown in a different sorting order, new messages will be
shown wherever they should appear in accordance with the current sort
order.
Most IMAP mail accounts show new mail as soon as it is received.
Some IMAP mail accounts do not report new mail immediately after it is
delivered to the mail folder (this depends on the IMAP server software).
&app; checks for new mail at regular intervals, and new received messages
will show up after the next check for new mail.</para>

      <para>
New mail delivered to a local mbox folder will usually be shown when
&app; checks for new mail, at regularly-scheduled intervals.
New mail delivered to a local maildir will also usually appear only after
&app; checks for new mail.
On most Linux and SGI systems, and on any other system that has the File
Access Monitor daemon running, new mail will be reported immediately.</para>

      <para>
In all cases, move to the last message in the folder, and use the
cursor down key to have &app; explicitly checks for new mail.
New mail in a POP3 folder will only be shown after an explicit
new mail check (&app; does not check for new mail in POP3 folders by
itself).</para>

      <blockquote>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    There's a bug in <application>INN 2.5</application>, which should
	    be fixed in 2.5.3. The affected versions of

      <para>
In all cases, new mail will not be immediately shown after the folder
index screen is closed.
When the folder index
screen is closed, the mail folder still remains <quote>opened</quote>
until &app; opens another folder in the same mail account.
&app; still regularly checks for new mail when the folder index screen
is not being shown (except for POP3 accounts).
New mail will be reported only when &app; checks for new mail, or when
the folder index screen is reopened.</para>

      <title>Concurrent changes to the current folder's contents</title>

      <para>
Most mail accounts allow the same folder to be opened by multiple
applications.
When &app; has a folder opened, another application might also have the
same folder opened, and another application may be making changes to the
folder, at the same time.</para>

      <para>
Generally speaking, new mail delivered to the folder, while it's opened by
&app;, is one example of concurrent changes to the contents of the folder
while it is opened.  Other applications may make other kinds of
changes to the folder's contents: changing a message's status
(whether the message is unread, deleted, replied, tagged, and/or flagged);
or removing a message from the folder.
In general, changes by other applications are reported in the
same manner that &app; reports new mail.
If &app; reports new mail as soon as it is received, &app; will also
report other kinds of changes to the folder's contents as soon as they occur.
Otherwise, changes to the folder's contents are reported the next time
&app; checks for new mail.
An attempt to access a message that was removed by another application,
but not yet reported, usually results in an error.</para>
