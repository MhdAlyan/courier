  <title>Encryption Menu</title>

    <para>
Choosing <quote>Encryption Menu</quote> from &app;'s main menu
(which is available if <application>GnuPG</application> is installed)
opens a menu with the following selections:</para>

    <variablelist> 
      <varlistentry>
	<term>New encryption key</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
This selection creates a pair of public and private keys,
which may be used for signing and encryption.
Fill in the fields on the next screen with the appropriate information:
the name, the E-mail address, and the comment associated with the keypair;
how big the encryption keys should be (a different length may be chosen
for creating signed content, and for creating encrypted content); whether
the keys have an expiration date; and the passphrase, or a password, for the
private key.  The passphrase must be entered twice, in both fields, and both
fields must match.  Leave both passphrase fields empty to create a private key
without a passphrase.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Delete key</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
This selection deletes an existing key.
Public and private keys are deleted separately.
All installed keys are displayed in a vertical list.
Highlight a key with the cursor, and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to delete
it.</para>

	  <para>
The top half of the screen shows detailed information about the current key
that's highlighted by the cursor.  Due to limited amount of available space,
keys with more than one signatures may not have all signatures shown.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Sign key</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
This selection signs an existing public key with one of the private keys.
The public key, and the private key are selected one at a time.
All installed keys are displayed in a vertical list.
Highlight a key with the cursor, and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap> to select
it.</para>

	  <para>
The top half of the screen shows detailed information about the current key
that's highlighted by the cursor.  Due to limited amount of available space,
keys with more than one signatures may not have all signatures shown.</para>

	  <para>
After selecting the public key, and then the private key, the last prompt
asks for the signature's trust level, which is used by
<application>GnuPG</application> to calculate the key's trustworthiness.</para>
	</listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>Edit key</term>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
This last selection provides a convenient means for accessing advanced
key management features through the <application>GnuPG</application>
application which are not directly implemented in &app;.
Selecting <quote>Edit key</quote> shows a list of all available keys.
Highlight an available key with the cursor, and press <keycap>ENTER</keycap>.
&app; then runs <application>GnuPG</application> and opens
<application>GnuPG</application> key management menu that provides access
to additional key management features, such as advanced signature and
passphrase management.
After <application>GnuPG</application> exits &app; resumes running
automatically.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>
&app; does not run while <application>GnuPG</application> is running, and
it waits for <application>GnuPG</application> to finish before resuming.
If <application>GnuPG</application> runs for an extended period of time,
&app;'s connections to remote mail server may be terminated due to
inactivity.</para>
