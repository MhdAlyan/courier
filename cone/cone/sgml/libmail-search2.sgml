  <para>
Efficient searching is implemented for local mail, and IMAP/SMAP
mailboxes only.
NetNews servers' searching capabilities are very limited, and POP3 servers
have no search facilities whatsoever.
In all cases, searching for message status flags is supported, since
message status flags are always cached locally.</para>

      <para>
Only message headers of NetNews folders may be searched, and only English
characters can be used as a search string.
Some older NetNews servers may not have any searching ability whatsoever.
Searching of message contents is not supported.
Searching by message size, or message's date is not supported either.</para>

      <para>
Searching of POP3 folders is also not very efficient, although the search
text is not limited to English characters only.
POP3 folder search is accomplished by downloading the complete headers of
each message, and searching it manually.
Downloaded headers are not cached.
The headers are also downloaded when searching by message's date.
Searching by message size, or message's date is not supported for POP3
folders.</para>
