  <title>Master Passwords</title>

    <para>
Passwords for remote mail accounts are not usually saved, and they must be
entered every time when opening the account.
The <quote>Master Password</quote> option on the main menu replaces all
remote account passwords with a single master password.
The master password must still be entered every time when starting
&app;.
However, all other remote mail account passwords are saved,
and used automatically.
The master password encrypts the file where remote mail account passwords are
saved.
The master password also encrypts imported <acronym>SSL</acronym> certificates
(they are saved together with remote mail account passwords).</para>

    <para>
The master password may be changed at any time, by selecting this option
from the main menu.
Answering <quote>Y</quote> to <quote>Remove master password?</quote> deletes
all saved passwords, and mail account passwords must, once again, be entered
each time when opening remote mail accounts.</para>

    <para>
A master password cannot be recovered, once forgotten.  The only available
option is to remove the master password.
All saved passwords will be lost.</para>
