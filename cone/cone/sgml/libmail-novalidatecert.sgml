Do not validate the server's SSL certificate when using an encrypted
connection.
Normally the mail server's SSL certificate must be validate when using an
encrypted connection.
The certificate's name must match the server's name, and the certificate
must be signed by a trusted certificate authority.</para>

		<para>
The encrypted connection normally
fails if the certificate cannot be validate.
Validation requires that a list of trusted certificate
authorities must be known and configured.
It's simply impossible to know
which certificate authorities are valid without an explicit list of valid,
known,
trusted, certificate authorities.  If a trusted authority
list is not configured, no certificate can be validated.  If the server's
certificate is a self-signed certificate (this is often used for testing
purposes), or if it's not signed by a known authority, the encrypted connection
fails.</para>

		<para>
This <literal>/novalidate-cert</literal> option disables certificate
validation.
The encrypted connection will be established even if the server's certificate
would otherwise be rejected.</para>

		<note>
		  <para>
This option is applicable even when an encrypted IMAP or POP3 connection
is not explicitly requested.
Many mail servers are capable of automatically upgrading unencrypted
connections to a fully-encrypted connection.
If a mail server claims to be able to use encryption, then there's no reason
not to use it.  The result is that all encryption certification requirements
still apply even when encryption is not explicitly requested.</para>
