&app; is a screen-oriented E-mail/News reader and writer.
If you are reading this documentation from within &app;, you are actually
reading the simplified HTML version of &app;'s documentation that's formatted
as a folder of E-mail messages.
Each online tutorial chapter appears as a separate message.
Use <keycap>PgUp</keycap> and
<keycap>PgDn</keycap> to read each chapter.
Press <keycap>N</keycap> and
<keycap>P</keycap> to move to the next/previous chapter.</para>

    <para>
It might be more convenient to
browse the full HTML documentation using your favorite web browser,
at
<ulink url="http://www.courier-mta.org/cone/cone00index.html">http://www.courier-mta.org/cone/cone00index.html</ulink>.
When &app; starts for the first time, it automatically creates a fake
mail account called <quote>Online Tutorial</quote>.
This fake mail account contains a stripped-down HTML version of
the online documentation, which you are reading now.
The terminal display must be at least 80 characters wide in order
to be able to read <quote>Online Tutorial</quote>.</para>

    <para>
The <quote>Online Tutorial</quote> mail account can always be removed, but
it might be convenient to keep it around for a quick consultation, from time
to time, even though the full HTML version is a bit easier on the eyes.</para>

      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>
&app; is a powerful, yet simple, text-based mail reader.
&app; seamlessly handles multiple mail accounts simultaneously.
&app; is capable of using the following kinds of mail accounts:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Local mail folders, or maildirs.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Remote POP3 and IMAP mail server accounts.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
A simple newsgroup reader.
&app; doesn't have sophisticated features found in dedicated newsreaders,
and may be a bit slow and memory hungry when reading large Usenet newsgroups.
However, &app; will prove to be an excellent, fast, reader of internal
local newsgroups, accessible via a remote login.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Experimental SMAP mail server accounts.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
&app; contains an experimental implementation of a new remote mail access
protocol, <quote>SMAP</quote>.
At this time, SMAP is implemented by the
<ulink url="http://www.courier-mta.org">Courier-IMAP</ulink> server.
SMAP offers several improvements over traditional IMAP-based mail accounts,
namely:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Names of SMAP folders may use the full UTF-8 character set.
Most IMAP servers restrict certain characters from appearing in names of
folders, due to their special meaning in the IMAP folder hierarchy.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Faster downloading of binary attachments.
SMAP requires approximately 25% less bandwidth to download binary
attachments.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Consolidated mail transmission.
IMAP clients usually need to transmit a message twice, when mailing it.
An IMAP client must first save the message in the IMAP server's
<quote>Sent Mail</quote> folder.
Afterwards, the IMAP client needs to send a second copy of the message,
using SMTP, in order to deliver it to the listed recipients.
When using SMAP, &app; transmits the message only one time; the server
saves it to the <quote>Sent Mail</quote> folder, then mails it to its
designated recipients.</para>

	  <para>
Of course, &app; is fully capable of using traditional SMTP, or running the
local <command>sendmail</command> command.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>
Other features of &app;:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
Full SSL/TLS support with IMAP, POP3, NNTP, SMTP, and SMAP.
SASL CRAM-MD5/CRAM-SHA1 authentication (except for NNTP).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Built-in editor for creating messages.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Full UTF-8 support (requires the wide-character version of the
<application>Curses</application> library).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Spell checker.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Local and remote (IMAP or SMAP-based) addressbooks.</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
Remote configuration (share a common configuration between different
instances of &app;).</para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
&app; tries to automatically customize itself to user's preferences, without
requiring explicit configuration.
&app; remembers the sorting order of each opened folder's index.
When a folder is reopened, &app; sorts the folder using the same sort order
used when the folder was opened last.
Similarly, &app; memorizes user-configured mail headers.
<literal>From:</literal>, and several other, mail headers are freely editable,
and default to their contents the last time a new message was sent by
replying to a message in the folder, or which was created while that folder
was opened.
A <quote>power user</quote> can easily use multiple mail accounts with
&app;, and &app; will select the appropriate mail headers when replying
to messages from each mail account.</para>
