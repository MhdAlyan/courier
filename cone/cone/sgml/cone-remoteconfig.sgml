  <title>Remote Configuration</title>

  <para>
This is an advanced feature.
When <quote>Remote Configuration</quote> is enabled,
an IMAP or an
<link linkend="smap1">SMAP</link> folder on a remote folder keeps
a copy of &app;'s
configuration.
This allows &app;'s configuration to be accessed from multiple systems.
An otherwise empty IMAP/SMAP folder must be reserved for this purpose.
Highlight the folder with the cursor on the folder listing screen, then
press <keycap>U</keycap> then <keycap>R</keycap>.</para>

  <para>
Answer <keycap>N</keycap> to the <quote>Import remote configuration</quote>
question, and &app; will save its configuration to the remote folder, and
automatically update the saved configuration, when needed.</para>

  <para>
Repeat the process by running &app; on another system, and answer
<keycap>Y</keycap> to this question to import the previously saved
configuration in this folder.
&app; imports and reads the saved configuration, and will also automatically
udpate the saved copy, when needed.</para>

  <para>
Although this feature allows the same configuration to be accessed
from multiple locations, only one instance of &app; should be running at
any given time and using the same remote configuration folder.
Random errors will be reported if multiple instances of &app; try to
open the same
remote configuration folder, and the IMAP/SMAP server does not allow the same
folder to be opened by two or more clients.
Even if the server allows multiple access, &app; configuration will keep
getting overwritten by the other &app;'s saved configuration, leading to
unpredictable results.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Saved settings</title>

    <para>
Not all configuration information will be saved remotely.
When remote configuration is enabled, the following configuration will be
saved in the remote configuration folder:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Location and login information for remote accounts (IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and
NetNews).
Location of local mail accounts is not saved.
It doesn't make much sense to share location of local mailboxes between
different systems.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Customized headers, E-mail addresses, special folders, and folder sort
order.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
The following configuration information will not be saved remotely:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
Location of local mail accounts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
Cached data, including newsgroup subscription information.
The configuration and login information of NetNews accounts is saved
remotely, however the available newsgroup list, subscription information,
and list of read and unread articles is not saved.
The <filename>newsrc</filename> configuration file, which contains all that,
can be quite big, and its not feasible to save it remotely.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

      <section>
	<title>Disabling remote configuration</title>

	<para>
To disable remote configuration, open the setup screen from the main menu,
highlight <quote>Turn off remote configuration</quote>, and press
<keycap>ENTER</keycap>.</para>
