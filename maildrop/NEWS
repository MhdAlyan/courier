Maildrop 1.2
------------

The major change in maildrop 1.2 is that the legacy installation layout has
been finally removed. maildrop now installs in the standard GNU/FHS-compliant
installation directories.  The standard options to configure, --prefix,
--exec-prefix, and others, are now used as intended.

Additionally, development libraries are also installed.  The development
libraries contain functions that may be useful for programs and applications
that parse E-mail and MIME headers.
