  <h1>maildrop 2.4</h1>

  <p>When maildrop is configured to use system accounts, if a
  maildrop filtering recipe runs an external program, the group id
  of the external program may now be different then what it was in
  previous version of maildrop, if the maildrop binary is installed
  with the set-group-id bit set.</p>

  <p>Previously, maildrop started the external process using either
  the recipient's group id, or the group id of the process that
  invoked maildrop (presumably your mail server's group id),
  depending on the system configuration. This was not immediately
  apparent, or very intuitive, and could've been overlooked leading
  to security-related implications.</p>

  <p>Starting with this version of maildrop, the external program's
  userid will be either the recipient's group id, or the group id
  specified by the set-group-id bit on maildrop's binary.</p>

  <p>If in earlier versions of maildrop, maildrop's group id was
  the recipient's group id, there is no change. If in earlier
  version of maildrop, maildrop's binary had the set-group-id bit
  set, processes started by maildrop will run using the same group
  id.</p>

  <p>You are impacted by this change if:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>You have maildrop installed with the set group id bit set
      on the binary</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>You have maildrop configured to deliver mail to system
      accounts</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Your mailbox directory (usually /var/spool/mail) does not
      have the sticky bit set</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>If all of the above is true, you will need to verify and
  confirm that the new maildrop behavior meets your security
  model.</p>

  <h1>maildrop 2.0</h1>

  <p>Version 2.0 introduces a new pattern matching engine that uses
  the <tt>PCRE</tt> library, that uses a completely different
  syntax. However, very few changes should be required to upgrade
  existing maildrop recipes to the new syntax.</p>

  <p>Review the <tt>maildropfilter</tt> manual page which has been
  revised to document the new pattern matching syntax. The legacy
  pattern matching engine is still available by setting
  <tt>MAILDROP_OLD_REGEXP</tt> to <tt>1</tt>. See also the
  "Conversion of maildrop 1.x pattern to 2.0" section in the manual
  page, for more information.</p>

  <h1>maildrop 1.2</h1>

  <p>If you're upgrading from maildrop 0.74 or earlier, read the
  next section, then come back here.</p>

  <p>Starting with maildrop 1.2, the installation directories will
  use the GNU layout. It might be painful, but it has to be done.
  The previous installation directories were based on two years'
  worth of legacy code, and had to go, in order for maildrop to be
  able to be shipped in a distribution.</p>

  <p>The installation layout used by maildrop 1.1 and earlier:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin</code> - binaries.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/man</code> - manual pages.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/html</code> - HTML
  documentation.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin</code> - soft links to binaries in
  <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin</code>.</p>

  <p>Starting with maildrop 1.2, maildrop will use the GNU
  installation layout:</p>

  <p><code>{bindir}</code> - binaries.</p>

  <p><code>{mandir}</code> - manual pages.</p>

  <p><code>{datadir}/maildrop</code> - scripts and HTML
  documentation.</p>

  <p>For scripts that are intended to be invoked from the shell
  command line, there will be soft links from {bindir} to
  {datadir}/maildrop.</p>

  <p>This means that the default installation layout will be as
  follows:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin</code> - binaries.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/man</code> - manual pages.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/share/maildrop</code> - scripts and HTML
  documentation.</p>

  <p>maildrop 1.2 also installs development libraries. They are
  optional, and can be removed after installation, if not needed.
  The development files will be installed in {libdir} and
  {includedir}. The default installation layout would be:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/include</code> - include files.</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib</code> - libraries.</p>

  <h2>Manually upgrading from earlier versions of maildrop</h2>

  <p>The recommended upgrade path is to first manually remove the
  previous version of maildrop, then install the new version of
  maildrop afterwards.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading using the packaged RPM build script</h2>

  <p>The packaged RPM build script now installs maildrop in
  <code>/usr/bin</code>, instead of the previous
  <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. This is because the build script now
  uses the platform build defaults.</p>

  <p>The new script also puts manual pages into a separate RPM, as
  well as creating a separate devel RPM with the libraries and
  include files.</p>

  <h1>maildrop 0.75</h1>

  <p>Read this document if you're upgrading from 0.74, or
  earlier.</p>

  <p>Maildrop 0.75 includes several bug fixes to the userdb
  scripts, however the main change in 0.75 is a different
  installation layout.</p>

  <p>Maildrop versions 0.74 and earlier used the following
  installation layout. Typically, the following files were
  installed in the directory <code>/usr/local/bin</code>:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/dotlock</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/reformail</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/reformime</code> - core maildrop
  binaries</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/maildirmake</code> - soft link to
  <code>maildrop.maildirmake</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.maildirmake</code></p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/makedat</code> - soft link
  to<code>maildrop.makedat</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.makedat</code> - optionally
  installed if GDBM/DB support is selected during configuration</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/deliverquota</code> - soft link
  to<code>maildrop.deliverquota</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.deliverquota</code> - optionally
  installed if maildir quota support is selected during
  configuration</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/makeuserdb</code> - soft link to
  <code>maildrop.makeuserdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/pw2userdb</code> - soft link to
  <code>maildrop.pw2userdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/userdb</code> - soft link to
  <code>maildrop.userdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.makeuserdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.pw2userdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop.userdb</code> - optional scripts
  installed if userdb support is selected during
  configuration<br />
  <code>/usr/local/man</code> - various manual pages were installed
  underneath this directory.</p>

  <p>There was a reason why I initially decided to use this
  particular installation layout. At least, I think I had one.</p>

  <p>Although I haven't received any comments on this layout, I
  believe that this layout is not very convenient, and may be
  confusing. So I've decided to try a new installation layout
  starting with maildrop 0.75. My goals were:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A logical, straightforward layout</li>

    <li>Try to avoid breaking any existing stuff</li>

    <li>Allow easier management. For example, permit a quick and
    painless way to roll back to a previous release of
    <code>maildrop</code> (for some future releases, of
    course).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Maildrop 0.75 and onward will use the following installation
  layout by default:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin</code> - all base and
  optional binaries will be installed here</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/man</code> - all manual pages
  will be installed here</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/html</code> - all HTML versions
  of manual pages, and additional documentation, will be installed
  here.</p>

  <p>Soft links in <code>/usr/local/bin</code>. The installation
  script will install the following soft links in the
  <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory. The following soft links
  will point to the binaries that are installed in the
  <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/bin</code> directory:</p>

  <p><code>/usr/local/bin/maildrop</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/reformail</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/reformime</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/dotlock</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/maildirmake</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/makedat</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/deliverquota</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/makeuserdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/pw2userdb</code><br />
  <code>/usr/local/bin/userdb</code><br /></p>

  <p>Configuration switches that select whether or not certain
  optional binaries are installed will remain the same.</p>

  <p>Basically, anything that expects to find things in
  <code>/usr/local/bin</code> should continue to work.</p>

  <p>However, when you are ready to install a later release of
  maildrop, you can simply move your current
  <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop</code> directory before installing
  the later release. In the event that you need to back out to the
  previous version of maildrop, you can do that simply by removing
  the newly installed <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop</code>
  directory, and moving the previous one in its place.</p>

  <p>I think that this is a definite improvement from the previous
  layout.</p>

  <h2>Upgrading from maildrop 0.74 and earlier</h2>

  <p>If you compile and install maildrop 0.74 from the original
  source code tarball, you can proceed to configure, compile, and
  install maildrop as usual. You can use the <code>--prefix</code>
  option to the <code>configure</code> script to change the main
  installation directory from <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop</code>
  to something else. If your previous version of maildrop was not
  installed in the default directory <code>/usr/local/bin</code>,
  you can use the <code>--bindir</code> option to the configure
  script to specify your non-default installation directory.</p>

  <p><code>make install</code> should be able to create the correct
  soft links. After running <code>make install</code>, or
  <code>make install-strip</code>, you will need to manually
  perform the following steps:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Manually remove any old maildrop binaries from
    <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, such as
    <code>maildrop.makedat</code>,
    <code>maildrop.deliverquota</code>, and others. Anything
    <code>maildrop.*</code> can be removed.</li>

    <li>New manual pages are installed underneath the main
    <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop</code> directory. You will need
    to remove old manual pages from the <code>/usr/local/man</code>
    directory. Find all files underneath
    <code>/usr/local/man</code> that begin with "maildrop". You
    will also need to look for a corresponding soft link that
    points to each manual page.</li>

    <li>Configure your <code>man(1)</code> command to search
    <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/man</code> for manual pages,
    which is where maildrop's manual pages are now installed. In
    most cases, you need to simply add the path
    <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/man</code> to the MANPATH
    environment variable. If you use the Bourne or Bash shells,
    simply add the following code to
    <code>/etc/profile</code>:<br />
    <br />
    <code>MANPATH="/usr/local/lib/maildrop:$MANPATH"</code><br />
    <code>export MANPATH</code></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Upgrading binary RPMS for Red Hat Linux</h2>

  <p>I recommend that instead of using the rpm -U command to
  upgrade your binary RPM, you should first remove the old maildrop
  rpm, using rpm -e, then install the new RPM using rpm -i.</p>

  <p>The binary RPM takes care of setting the MANPATH variable.
  Also, note that the binary RPM installes the HTML version of
  manual pages, plus additional documentation, in
  <code>/usr/doc</code> instead of
  <code>/usr/local/lib/maildrop/html</code>.</p>
