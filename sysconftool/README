To install this version of sysconftool:

./configure
make
make install

That's it.

If you have rpm, you don't need to extract the tarball:

rpm -ta sysconftool-VERSION.tar.gz

This will create sysconftool-VERSION.noarch.rpm and
sysconftool-VERSION.src.rpm.  Simply install noarch.rpm, and you're all set.
The RPM build script requires RPM 4.0 or higher.
