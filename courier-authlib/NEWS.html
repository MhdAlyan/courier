  <h1>Courier Authentication Library</h1>

  <p>The Courier Authentication Library is a required component
  that must be set up before installing other Courier packages: the
  Courier Mail Server or its components (Courier-IMAP, SqWebMail,
  or maildrop).</p>

  <p>The authentication library used to be included as a part of
  these packages, it is now a standalone library.</p>

  <p>Upgrading from older versions of Courier packages that used to
  include this authentication library internally should be as
  simple as:</p>
  <pre>
./configure
make
make install
make install-migrate
make install-configure
</pre>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>The Courier authentication library should not have any more
  requirements than the older Courier packages it used to be a part
  of. There may be an exception on some less-common platforms. They
  may require some additional stuff to be loaded before
  courier-authlib can be installed. This is because courier-authlib
  now uses <code>libtool</code>, which is a new requirement.
  Courier-authlib now uses shared libraries in the place of
  separate authdaemond binaries in the previous versions. Some
  less-common platforms may require additional software to be
  installed because of that, see INSTALL for more information.</p>

  <h2>The pluses</h2>

  <p>This new, self-sustaining Courier authentication library
  offers the following benefits:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Upgrading from Courier-IMAP or SqWebMail to the full
    Courier package does not require authentication
    re-configuration.</li>

    <li>Consolidated documentation. Instructions for setting up
    MySQL, PostgreSQL, and the rest, are currently duplicated
    twice, making it a maintenance pain. Now, the documentation
    will be in one place, and can be easily improved, and
    overhauled. There will be an initial hump to ride over, to
    reconcile the minor differences in the authentication
    documentation in Courier, Courier-IMAP, and SqWebMail. Going
    forward, though, everything will be in one place.</li>

    <li>The authentication API appears to be fairly stable and
    robust. It will not be necessary to update the courier-authlib
    package with every upgrade. Updates to courier-authlib are
    expected to be very infrequent.</li>

    <li>There is a small minority of established systems that use
    the standalone SqWebMail and Courier-IMAP packages. The
    consolidated courier-authlib library will, as a bonus, provide
    an official way to use only one set of config files, in this
    configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The minuses</h2>

  <p>I can only see one possible drawback. Only the daemonized
  configuration will now be possible. This new version of the
  Courier authentication library is, for all intents and purposes,
  the daemonized configuration of the previous authentication
  library. The non-daemonized version of the authentication library
  is no longer implemented. That code has been removed for the
  simple reason that it can no longer be implemented, as a
  standalone library. It's been clearly shown that the daemonized
  configuration is the more flexible configuration, and is the only
  way to go. The daemonized configuration was the default
  configuration for several years.</p>

  <p>I can only see the following minuses from losing the
  non-daemonized configuration. I believe the minuses are greatly
  outranked by the pluses.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There are some third party configuration libraries that
    only work in a non-daemonized configuration. I'm aware of one
    such library, vmailmgr. Unless it's been updated to work in
    daemonized mode, it will no longer work.</li>

    <li>There are also some other third-party hacks that also only
    work in a non-daemonized configuration. There's at least one
    relay-after-imap or relay-after-pop hack for qmail, that only
    works in a daemonized configuration. I believe that
    relay-after-X hacks have been obsolete for several years now.
    Every mail client worth mentioning these days implemented
    authenticated SMTP, and the relay-after-X hacks need to
    go.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Currently, there are also some borderline configurations
  possible in a non-daemonized configuration, such as using
  different authentication modules completely for imap and pop3, or
  different authentication modules for non-encrypted and encrypted
  connections. This will no longer be possible, but I doubt that
  there's any valid reason to use such an unusual setup.</p>

  <h2>Testing</h2>

  <p>The '<code>make install-migrate</code>' command tries to
  import the authentication configuration from any existing
  installed Courier package. The configuration files for
  courier-authlib will end up in
  <code>/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib/etc/authlib</code>. The
  existing Courier packages don't really know how to use
  courier-authlib just yet. This will be the next step.</p>

  <p>However, after installing courier-authlib you should be able
  to do some rudimentary testing by running '<code>authdaemond
  start</code>' (where authdaemond is what's in the
  <code>/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib/sbin</code> directory). The
  following commands should now work (make sure the
  <code>authdaemond</code> and <code>authtest</code> programs are
  the ones from <code>/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib/sbin</code>
  directory, and not any existing Courier directory):</p>
  <pre>
authtest userid
authtest userid password
authtest userid password newpassword
authenumerate
</pre>

  <p>The first command displays the account's home directory,
  userid, groupid, and other related data. The second command
  verifies whether the password is valid, or not. The third command
  changes the password on the account (be careful with that).</p>

  <p>The goal is that everything should work automatically. In some
  cases, it might be necessary to modify the new authdaemonrc
  configuration file (unlike all othe configuration files, the
  <code>install-migrate</code> script won't copy the existing
  <code>authdaemonrc</code>, a new one will be installed). Manually
  edit it, and remove all authentication modules that are not
  needed, leaving only the actual ones that are used.</p>

  <h2>Debugging</h2>

  <p>To generate additional debugging messages, edit the
  authdaemond startup script (installed in /usr/local/bin by
  default), and add the following to the script:</p>
  <pre>
DEBUG_LOGIN=2
export DEBUG_LOGIN
</pre>

  <p>Debugging messages from the authentication daemon processes
  will be sent to the syslog facility, and recorded in whatever log
  file syslog is configured to use (usually
  <code>/var/log/messages</code> or
  <code>/var/log/maillog</code>).</p>
