# Test CRAM-MD5 (RFC 2195) authentication. See also RFC 1734 for POP3 AUTH.

# To duplicate the example in RFC 2195:
#   $ perl testcrammd5.pl 
#   Username? tim
#   Password? tanstaaftanstaaf
#   Challenge? PDE4OTYuNjk3MTcwOTUyQHBvc3RvZmZpY2UucmVzdG9uLm1jaS5uZXQ+
#   Response:
#   dGltIGI5MTNhNjAyYzdlZGE3YTQ5NWI0ZTZlNzMzNGQzODkw

# To use with courier-imap:
#    telnet localhost 110
#    capa
#      << check for SASL CRAM-MD5 in response
#    auth cram-md5
#      << note the challenge, paste it into this program
#      << paste back the response
#
# or:
#    telnet localhost 143
#      << check for [CAPABILITY ... AUTH=CRAM-MD5 ...] in response
#    a authenticate cram-md5
#      << note the challenge, paste it into this program
#      << paste back the response

# Remember: to get CRAM-MD5 authentication working in Courier-IMAP you
# need to set several things:
#  - settings POP3AUTH in pop3d and/or IMAP_CAPABILITY in imapd
#  - in userdb set attribute hmac-md5pw (or pop3-hmac-md5pw etc)
#       userdbpw -hmac-md5 | userdb fred@flintstone.org set hmac-md5pw
#       Password: 
#       Reenter password: 
#       makeuserdb
#  - in mysql/pgsql/ldap set cleartext password
