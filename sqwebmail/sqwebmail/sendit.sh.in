# This is a sample sendit wrapper for sqwebmail. sqwebmail will invoke this
# wrapper script to send an email message.  The complete message will be
# provided on standard input.
#
# $1 will contain the return (or bounce) address for this mailboxid, as
# specified by auth.c
#
# $2 will contain the sqwebmail mailboxid of the sender (note that we're
# executing under whatever id auth.c sets for this mailboxid).  Furthermore,
# $REMOTE_ADDR will contain the IP address where the client is coming from
# (the rest of the CGI vars are available too).
#
# The environment variable DSN will contain any requested -N option to
# sendmail (not used by qmail).
#
# You may modify the message in whatever fashion before passing it on to the
# MTA.
