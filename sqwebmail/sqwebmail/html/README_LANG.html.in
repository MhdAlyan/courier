<h1>SqWebMail Language translations</h1>

<p>Starting with version 0.23, SqWebMail includes configuration scripts in the
html subdirectory (the one where you found this file) which make it possible
to be able to add translated HTML templates to SqWebMail very easily. You will
be able to create and maintain the translated HTML templates all by
yourself.</p>

<p>Before you set up a translated HTML template set, you will need to have the
following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ISO code/locality for your translation. For example, I distribute
    SqWebMail with the HTML templates for en-us - English-US. If, for example,
    you wanted to create an HTML template set for English-British, your ISO
    code/locality would be en-gb. If you wanted to create an HTML template set
    for French, your ISO code/locality would be fr-fr, and so on.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Locale code. This is the name of the i18n locale that's installed on
    your system. The locale primarily determines how dates are displayed. It
    is usually very similar to the ISO code/locality. For example, the i18n
    locale for English-US is en_US, for English-British it's en_GB, for French
    it's fr_FR. Try checking for the LOCALE environment variable, the manual
    page for locale(7), or the contents of <tt>/usr/share/locale</tt>
    directory.<br>

    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The MIME character set. This specifies the character set of messages in
    this language. For most european languages, it is iso-8859-1.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The name of the ispell dictionary for your language. For example, for
    English-US, the corresponding ispell dictionary is called "american", for
    German, it's "german".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Extract sqwebmail, and run configure</h2>

<p>First, you want to take the standard <tt>sqwebmail-@VERSION@.tar.gz</tt>
tarball, and extract it, then run the <tt>configure</tt> script with your
usual options:</p>

<p><tt>$ tar xzvf sqwebmail-@VERSION@.tar.gz</tt><br>
<tt>$ cd sqwebmail-@VERSION@</tt><br>
<tt>$ ./configure [ your usual options go here ]</tt></p>

<p>Change to the html subdirectory.</p>

<p><tt>$ cd html</tt></p>

<p>The standard <tt>sqwebmail-@VERSION.tar.gz</tt> includes the subdirectory
html/en-us. Let's say you want to translate it into French.</p>

<p>The ISO code/locality is fr-fr.</p>

<p>The locale code is fr_FR.</p>

<p>The ispell dictionary name is "french".</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to be done is to create another subdirectory in
html. The name of the subdirectory must be the ISO code/locality for the
language.</p>

<p>You don't have to do it by hand. There's a special target in html/Makefile
that will do it for you!</p>

<p><tt>$ make clone from=en-us to=fr-fr</tt></p>

<p>This script takes the Makefile, the configure script, and other files from
the <tt>html/en-us</tt> subdirectory, and creates the <tt>html/fr-fr</tt>
subdirectory which will temporary contain the mirror image of the
<tt>html/en-us</tt> subdirectory.</p>

<h2>Setting LANGUAGE_PREF</h2>

<p>You now have to make minor changes to some files in the fr-fr subdirectory.
<tt>fr-fr/LANGUAGE</tt> will be automatically created by the make clone
script. However, you must initialize the contents of the
<tt>fr-fr/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt> file:</p>

<p><tt>$ echo fr50 fr-fr >fr-fr/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt></p>

<p>The LANGUAGE_PREF file must contain exactly one line with two words. The
second word must always be the ISO code/locality. The first word is used to
sort all the installed HTML templates alphabetically by ISO code/locality, and
it's used to selecte the preferred locality within the same ISO code.</p>

<p>For example, the contents of <tt>en-us/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt> is "en50 en-us".
Let's say you want to have both en-us and en-gb HTML templates. If you want
clients requesting the "en" HTML to receive the en-gb HTML, you will have to
set <tt>en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt> to something like "en40 en-gb":</p>

<p><tt>$ echo en40 en-gb >en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt></p>

<p>If you want clients requesting the "en" HTML to receive the en-us HTML, you
will have to do something like this:</p>

<p><tt>$ echo en60 en-gb >en-gb/LANGUAGE_PREF</tt></p>

<p>The first word in all the LANGUAGE_PREF files is used to sort the list of
all the available HTML templates, and the sorted list is used to select the
preferred locality within the same ISO code.</p>

<h2>Setting LOCALE</h2>

<p>Let's resume the example with the French translation. The next file that
needs to be changed is LOCALE. This file contains the locale code for the
language. For French, the locale code is fr_FR:</p>

<p><tt>$ echo fr_FR >fr-fr/LOCALE</tt></p>

<h2>Setting CHARSET</h2>

<p>The CHARSET file sets the MIME character set of outgoing messages. For US
and most european languages, this value should be <tt>iso-8859-1</tt></p>

<p><tt>$ echo iso-8859-1 >fr-fr/CHARSET</tt></p>

<h2>Setting ISPELLDICT</h2>

<p>Finally, you need to specify which dictionary ispell will use for spell
checking. For French, the dictionary is simply named "french":</p>

<p><tt>$ echo french >fr-fr/ISPELLDICT</tt></p>

<p>If you do not have an ispell dictionary for this language, initialize
ISPELLDICT with the name of the default dictionary.</p>

<h2>Rerunning the configure script</h2>

<p>You now need to rerun the configure script in the main sqwebmail
directory:</p>

<p><tt>$ cd ..<br>
$ ./configure [ options ]</tt></p>

<p>This reruns the configure script in the sqwebmail-@VERSION@ directory,
which will now pick up your new html/fr-fr subdirectory, which will be
configured in.</p>

<h2>Creating the actual translations</h2>

<p>Now, you can edit all the .html files in html/fr-fr, and replace all
English text with its French equivalent.</p>

<p>If you now do a make, followed by make install, the installation script
will install both the original en-us HTML templates and fr-fr HTML templates
together.</p>

<p>If you now run make dist:</p>

<p><tt>$ make dist</tt></p>

<p>This will create a new <tt>sqwebmail-@VERSION@.tar.gz</tt> tarball,
containing both sets of HTML templates, which you can now distribute!</p>

<h2>Updating translations for new versions of SqWebMail</h2>

<p>Well, what should you do when a new version of SqWebMail is available?</p>

<p>First, you need to determine whether or not there were any changes to the
contents of the <tt>html/en-us</tt> subdirectory. Then, you will have to apply
the same changes to the translated contents of the old <tt>html/fr-fr</tt>
subdirectory.</p>

<p>Then, repeat the previous procedure for the new version of SqWebMail, but
before running the <tt>configure</tt> script for the second time, copy all the
<tt>.html</tt> files from the previous version of SqWebMail (plus any changes
or new files) into the <tt>html/fr-fr</tt> subdirectory of the new
version.</p>
