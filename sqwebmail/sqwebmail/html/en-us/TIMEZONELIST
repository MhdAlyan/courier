# This file lists the available timezones in the login dropdown list
#
# The first entry, "* *", renders as an empty, default choice in the
# dropdown list.  It's impossible to provide a default list of every
# timezone in use, hence the default leaves your TZ setting untouched.
#
# You may wish to remove the default, and move up your local timezone
# up, since the first listed timezone is going to be the dropdown
# default.
