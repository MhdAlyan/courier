<h1>Known bugs in SqWebMail</h1>
<ul>
  <li>This is really not an SqWebMail bug. The UNIX version of Netscape
    Communicator reliably crashes when you edit a lot of text in a TEXTAREA
    input for some time. First, it attempts to allocate about 40 megabytes of
    RAM, then crashes soon thereafter. This is not my problem. Hit 'PREVIEW'
    periodically, to save your unsent work. If Communicator crashes, you can
    recover most of your text from the Drafts folder.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Another Communicator bug. When uploading an attachment, Communicator
    will hang if you select a directory instead of a file.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><p>In practice, SqWebMail is somewhat tolerant of the mailbox contents
    being changed in a middle of a session by another mail client, accessing
    the same account. Still, all bets are off, and be aware of potential
    consequences (such as clicking on one message, and the message coming up
    blank, or another message appearing).</p>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>A lot of disk space is temporarily required when a message is sent, or a
    new attachment is uploaded. When a message is sent, first the message is
    saved as a draft, in the Drafts folder. Then, the draft is rewritten to
    the Sent folder, and the copy in Drafts is deleted. Which means that if
    disk quotas are used, low quotas will make it somewhat difficult to send
    messages with large attachments. It gets even worse when files are
    uploaded as attachments. Say you already have a message with attachments,
    totalling 500KBs.  You are about to upload another 200KB file. First, your
    HTTP POST is saved in a temporary file - 200KB+change. Then, the uploaded
    file is extracted into another temporary file - 200KB. Then, a new version
    of your message is created, with the new attachment encoded using base64 -
    500KB+264KB. Total additional disk space required to handle a 200KB
    attachment: 200KB+200KB+764KB.  If you're using filesystem-based quotas,
    everything gets counted against your quota. It's not as bad if you're
    using the deliverquota maildir agent, which will ignore most of the
    baggage.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>And from the "it's not a bug but a feature" department. New caching and
    handling algorythm effective with version 0.11. The Trash folder is
    introduced. Instead of deleted messages now hanging around in their
    original folder before being purged (but displayed separately), deleted
    messages will now migrate to the Trash folder, before being purged later.
    When you select a message to be deleted, it will show up marked with the
    status of D in its original folder, if you go back to the folder contents
    page. When you leave the folder, it will now be moved to the Trash folder.
    <p>What really happens is that when you delete a message, SqWebMail will
    create a hard link into the Trash folder, then mark the message as deleted
    in the original folder. When you leave the folder, SqWebMail will go
    through the folder and unlink all deleted messages.</p>
    <p>Moving a message to another folder works exactly the same, except that
    the message is linked into that folder, instead of Trash.</p>
    <p>If you move a message to another folder, and you immediately go back to
    the folder contents window (or you move a message directly from the folder
    contents window), the message will show up as deleted. If you try to move
    a message again into another folder, this operation will quietly fail
    without giving you an error message.<br>
    <br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Because messages are displayed as a part of an HTML page (as a table
    cell, actually), styles and BODY attributes of HTML messages are lost.
    BGCOLOR should really become BGCOLOR of the table cell; similarly LINK,
    ALINK, VLINK should be implemented as a style, as well as any STYLE
    attributes from the BODY tag.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Netscape Communicator does not yet support all HTML 4.0 attributes. Once
    you move or delete a message from a mailbox, it's marked as a 'D', and you
    can't do anything with it. If you want to move the message again, go to
    the folder where you moved it to. In the folder contents page, messages
    marked with a D get a DISABLED attribute for their checkmark. Communicator
    does not support the disabled tag, so if you try to move or delete the
    message again, it'll be a no-op.</li>
</ul>
