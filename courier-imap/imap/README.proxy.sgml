  <title>The <application>Courier</application>
    IMAP/POP3 proxy</title>

  <para>
The <application>Courier</application>
IMAP and POP3 servers now include a built-in proxy aggregator.
With a proxy aggregator, the mail accounts are split between multiple,
independent servers, with an IMAP/POP3 server running on each individual
server.
A separate, proxy server sits in front and accepts ordinary IMAP
and POP3 connections.  It reads the login ID, determines which server the
account is located on, connects to the server, and logs in.
Then, for the lifetime on the login session the front-end server takes itself
out of the loop, and forwards all session traffic between the IMAP/POP3
client, and the back-end server.</para>

  <section id="requirements">
    <title>Requirements</title>

    <para>
The <application>Courier</application>
mail server can operate in IMAP/POP3 proxy mode only
when the <application>Courier</application> Authentication Library uses the
<literal>userdb</literal>,
<literal>LDAP</literal>,
<literal>MySQL</literal>, or the
<literal>PostgreSQL</literal> authentication module.
<emphasis>Challenge-Response (CRAM) authentication
will also work with the
<literal>LDAP</literal>,
<literal>MySQL</literal>, or the
<literal>PostgreSQL</literal> authentication module</emphasis>.
Yes, CRAM authentication will work (except for <literal>userdb</literal>).</para>
  </section>

  <section id="configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>
Follow the regular installation instructions to set up
The <application>Courier</application>
mail server with the actual mail accounts.
The proxy feature uses the <quote>account options</quote> feature of the
<application>Courier</application> Authentication Library,
specifically an option called <quote>mailhost</quote>.
Account option configuration process depends on the authentication module.
With <literal>userdb</literal>, account options are specified by the
<quote>options</quote> <literal>userdb</literal> attribute:</para>

    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
userdb user@example.com set options=mailhost=servera.example.com
</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>
Instructions for setting up account options with
<literal>LDAP</literal>,
<literal>MySQL</literal>, or
<literal>PostgreSQL</literal>, may be found in the appropriate configuration
file.  Briefly:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
In <filename>authldaprc</filename>, put
<quote>LDAP_AUXOPTIONS&lt;TAB&gt;mailhost=mailhost</quote>,
then populate the <quote>mailhost</quote> LDAP attribute
(this may entail modifications of the LDAP schema).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
In <filename>authmysqlrc</filename>, put
<quote>MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS&lt;TAB&gt;CONCAT("mailhost=",mailhost)</quote>
(or modify the existing <literal>MYSQL_AUXOPTIONS</literal> setting
accordingly), then create a <quote>mailhost</quote> column in the account
table.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
	<para>
In <filename>authpgsqlrc</filename>, put
<quote>PGSQL_AUXOPTIONS&lt;TAB&gt;'mailhost=' || mailhost</quote>
(or append <literal>",mailhost=" || mailhost</literal>
to an existing setting),
then create a <quote>mailhost</quote> column in the account
table.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
The <quote>mailhost</quote> option for each account should be the name of
the server where that account is located.
If possible, this should match, <emphasis>exactly</emphasis>,
the <envar>PROXY_HOSTNAME</envar> environment variable or the value
returned by the <quote>gethostname</quote> on the server.</para>

    <para>
The final step is to set <quote>IMAP_PROXY</quote> and/or
<quote>POP3_PROXY</quote> to <quote>1</quote> in the
<filename>imapd</filename> and/or the <filename>pop3d</filename>
configuration file, in the Courier configuration file directory on
the proxy server.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Using the same configuration files on all servers</title>

      <para>
It is possible to have both the proxy server, and the back-end servers with
the actual accounts, read the same configuration file that enables proxying.
Ordinarily, if the back-end server also has the proxy setting turned on, it
will also attempt to establish a proxy connection (to itself;
lather, rinse, repeat until the server runs out of sockets).</para>

      <para>
However, if the <quote>mailhost</quote> option matches the server's hostname,
as returned by <quote>gethostname</quote>, no proxying takes place.
Therefore, if specific attention and care is made, when setting up the
server names and account options, all servers can boot off the
same configuration file.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Alternative configurations</title>

      <para>
If the server names are set up properly, it's possible to set things up
without a dedicated front-end proxy aggregator server.
All mail accounts are divided between a pool of servers, who are just one,
big, happy family.
IMAP and POP3 clients can connect to any server, at random.
If they try to log into an account that happens to reside on the
same box, then everything will be ready to go.
If not, the server automatically opens a proxy connection to the right
box, and everything will be ready to go as well.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Homogenous environments</title>

      <para>
Both servers involved in a proxy connections should be running the
same version of the
<application>Courier</application> IMAP/POP3 server.
The proxy code included in the
Courier-IMAP package tarball will talk to
the server from the
Courier-MTA
package tarball that includes the same build of the IMAP daemon, and
vice-versa.
Run <quote>imapd --version</quote> to determine the build of the IMAP
daemon.</para>

      <para>
All servers
<emphasis>MUST</emphasis>
use the same identical <filename>imapd</filename>
and <filename>pop3d</filename> configuration files (with the possible
exception of the proxy flag).
The next section explains why.</para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Heterogenous environments</title>

      <para>
It should generally be possible to have the
The <application>Courier</application>
IMAP/POP3 server establish a proxy connection to some other third party,
non-<application>Courier</application>, IMAP or POP3 server.
Of course, the <application>Courier</application> Authentication Library
running on the proxy server must have the same understanding of the
account names and passwords as the other IMAP/POP3 server.
The main issue is the different levels of protocol implementations.</para>

      <para>
Both the IMAP and POP3 protocols have optional features that different
servers may or may not implement.
Some servers will implement certain optional features of the IMAP or POP3
protocol; other servers will implement different features parts.</para>

      <para>
When the IMAP/POP3 client connects to the server, the client typically
obtains the list of available optional features.
After logging in, the client will have no reason to expect that it's now
talking to a different server with a different set of protocol features.
Therefore, it may not be possible to use a Courier proxy with some
other IMAP/POP3 server that implements a widely different set of
features.
This may work with some clients, that don't make use of optional features;
while other clients will report strange, or unpredictable errors.</para>

      <para>
In some cases, setting the <literal>IMAP_PROXY_FOREIGN</literal> flag,
in
the <filename>imapd</filename> configuration file, may help.
This command will send a message to the IMAP client explicitly informing
the client that the list of available protocol features has changed;
however some clients may ignore or not implement this particular message.
There is no equivalent POP3 command.</para>

      <note>
	<para>
As previously mentioned the IMAP/POP3 clients may use any supported
authentication method, including CRAM authentication (in most cases),
with or without encryption, to log in.
However, Courier will always use plain userid/password authentication,
without encryption, to establish proxy connections.
When using a different server, that server must be configured to allow
plain userid/password authentication.</para>

	<para>
Note that the default configuration of the <literal>UW-IMAP</literal>
server requires encryption, and refuses non-encrypted connections.
Proxy connections are presumably carried over a private network, and
there is no reason to use encryption.
Therefore, the <literal>UW-IMAP</literal> server will have to be
re-configured to allow non-encrypted connections, if it's to be used
with Courier in proxy mode.</para>
