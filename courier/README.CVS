This repository does not store files that are automatically generated
by autoconf, automake, and libtool.  There's no reason to waste space
storing automatically-generated rubbish.

This means that you will not find configure, Makefile.in, config.h.in,
and the rest of that stuff in here.  The only thing you will get is
configure.in, Makefile,am, and maybe acconfig.h.

Therefore, in order to start compiling, you will have to obtain the
latest version of autoconf, automake, and possibly libtool (may or may
not be needed).  Then, you will need to rebuild configure and Makefile.in
by yourself.

NOTE: You will also need to install the sysconftool utility.  Download
sysconftool from http://www.courier-mta.org/sysconftool/.  This is a short
autoconf macro.

The autobloat script will hopefully take care of this for you.  Cross your
fingers, and run 'sh autobloat' in the checked out top directory.  It will
recursively run autoconf, automake, libtool, and sysconftool, in the current
directory, and all subdirectories.
