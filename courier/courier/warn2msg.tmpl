Hello, this is the Courier mailing list manager.  I manage the mailing
list <####>.

There have been problems delivering messages to you from this mailing
list.  Your address is not listed in the To: header of this warning
message because all mailing list messages are blind-carbon-copied.
Sometimes this can cause delivery failures because of broken mail
filters, and I want to make sure that this warning message also gets
returned as undeliverable, if this is the case here.

You were previously sent a warning message, containing a copy of
one undeliverable message.  The warning message itself was returned
as undeliverable.  If this probe message is also returned as
undeliverable, your address will be automatically removed from the
mailing list.
