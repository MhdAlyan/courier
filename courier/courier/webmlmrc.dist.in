#
##NAME: PORT:0
#
# This is the filename for webmlmd's socket.  This configuration file is
# manually parsed by webmlm, so the PORT setting cannot use any shell
# constructs, and cannot use quotes.
#
# PORT's directory must either be writable by the userid that owns the
# LISTS directories (see below), or webmlmd must be started by root.
# Additionally, the PORT socket must be accessible by the userid that
# executes the web cgi-bin scripts (nobody, in the default Apache
# configuration).

PORT=@localstatedir@/webmlm


##NAME: PIDFILE:0
#
# The PID file.  Don't change unless you know what you're doing.

PIDFILE="${PORT}.pid"


##NAME: PREFORK:0
#
# Number of processes pre-forked by webmlmd to handle web requests.

PREFORK=3

##NAME: LOGGEROPTS:0
#
# Placeholder to pass any special options to the courierlogger process

LOGGEROPTS=

##NAME: LISTS:0
#
# Set LISTS to a colon separate list of directories, just like the PATH
# variable.  Each directory in LISTS must be a directory created by couriermlm.
#
# All directories in LISTS must be owned by the same uid and gid, and webmlmd
# needs to be running under the same uid and gid.  If webmlmd is started by
# root, it will automatically drop its root privileges and set them to the
# correct uid and gid.  NOTE -- the PORT file, and the PIDFILE will still be
# created by the root user.
#
# Additionally:  the last component of each list directory must be unique.  No
# two directories in LISTS can have the same directory name (the last component
# of the path).
#
# Example:  LISTS=/home/lists/users-list:/home/lists/admin-list
