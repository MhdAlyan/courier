  <h2>The <code>local</code> module</h2>- support for delivering
  and originating messages on the local machine.

  <h3>Configuration files</h3><code>defaulthost</code> - default
  hostname after the @. Defaults to me.

  <p><code>virtualdomains</code> - virtual domains. Each line is of
  the form domain.tld&lt;tab&gt;user</p>

  <p><code>mailbox</code> - default user mailbox. If no .courier
  file, the message is delivered to this file or maildir, relative
  to the recipient's home directory.&nbsp; local will also append
  the dash-extension (if any) to the name of the directory or file
  (trailing / should NOT be specified!). mailbox may also start
  with a |, to specify a program to pipe the message to.</p>

  <h3>The default default</h3>As the last resort, local will
  attempt to deliver messages to:

  <p>A) maildrop, if maildrop is detected during compilation<br />
  B) procmail, if procmail is detected during compilation<br />
  C) <code>$HOME/Mailbox</code></p>

  <p>The following comments apply only when either procmail or
  maildrop are invoked under these condition. The following does
  not apply if procmail or maildrop are invoked from a .courier
  file, or from the <code>mailbox</code> configuration file.</p>

  <p>procmail will be invoked with the -f flag. procmail will
  receive one argument: COURIER=x, where x is the dash-extension.
  If the local address is user-foo-bar, procmail will be run with
  COURIER=foo.&nbsp; If there is no dash extension, procmail will
  be run with COURIER=-</p>

  <p>maildrop ...<br />
  &nbsp;</p>

  <h2>Shared library</h2><code>rewritedel</code> - if domain is
  listed in locals or virtualdomains, will accept delivery. If
  domain is in virtualdomains, prepends 'user-' to the local part
  of the address, then works with the local part from then on. If
  the local part is a valid userid, accepts delivery, otherwise if
  the local part is user-foo, strips off the foo, and tries again
  to check for the valid userid. If a valid userid is found, after
  stripping one or more portions, takes what was removed, "-foo",
  or maybe even "-foo-bar", prepends ".courier", and checks if the
  file exists in user's home. If not, error, mailbox not found.
  Otherwise the 'host' parameter is the userid, and the 'address'
  parameter is the extension of the courier file, or just a "-" for
  <code>$HOME/.courier</code>.

  <p>Rewrite function:</p>

  <p><code>local</code> - calls local.defaulthost, unless address
  contains exclamation marks.<br />
  <code>local.defaulthost</code> - appends @defaulthost, if domain
  name is missing.</p>

  <h2>Output module</h2>setuids to the user indicated in the host
  parameter.

  <p>If <code>$HOME</code> has the sticky bit set, defers the
  mail.</p>

  <p>attempts to open and read delivery instructions from .courier
  file specified by the address parameter. If can't open the file,
  or if it's empty, message is delivered to the default mailbox.
  Delivery instructions are read, a line at a time. Lines ending
  with \ are concatenated with the next one. A delivery instruction
  may specify a mailbox, a forwarding address !user@host, or a
  program delivery |</p>

  <p>The output module appends a Delivered-To:
  userid-ext@defaulthost header. If the header already exists, the
  message is bounced as a mailing loop.</p>

  <h2>Input module</h2>A soft link is installed from
  <code>bin/sendmail</code> (ho-ho) to
  <code>lib/local/sendmail</code>. sendmail is setgid-ed to mail,
  and is a wrapper for <code>bin/submit</code>. If called with the
  -bs flag, an attempt to run <code>bin/smtpd</code> is made.<br />
