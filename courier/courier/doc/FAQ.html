  <h2>Configuration and installation</h2>

  <h3><a name="configloop" id="configloop">Q: The
  <code>configure</code> script is stuck in an infinite
  loop</a></h3>

  <p>A: It's not. The <i>Courier</i> mail server is made up of over
  thirty modular pieces, and each one has its own
  <code>configure</code> script. All <code>configure</code> scripts
  are recursively executed. <code>configure</code> scripts are
  generated off a template, and share a lot of common code, so when
  <code>configure</code> runs, it seems like the same script is
  being executed over and over again.</p>

  <h3><a name="authlib" id="authlib">Q: What's the deal with
  authentication modules? Why can't I get
  OpenLDAP/MySQL/PAM/whatever working?</a></h3>

  <p>A: The authentication library used by the <i>Courier</i> mail server
  (and the <i>Courier</i> mail server-IMAP, and SqWebMail) is probably
  the most thorniest part of the package. Some people just breeze
  through authentication module configuration, others just have one
  problem after another. There is no single point at which people
  get stuck. Any one of a set of problems can materialize and
  brings things to a halt. This FAQ entries explains the
  authentication modules in greater detail. The information given
  here should be sufficient to get everything in working order.</p>

  <p>The authentication modules serve three purposes:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Determine if a given E-mail or a login name is valid, or
    not.</li>

    <li>Determine if the password that is used to access the mail
    account is valid.</li>

    <li>Determine where the mailbox for this mail account lives on
    the system.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The authentication modules are generally used in one of two
  ways:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A. When delivering an E-mail message, The <i>Courier</i> mail
    server uses functions #1 and #3 to figure out where the mail
    needs to go.</p>

    <p>B. When the owner of the mail account logs in to read the
    mail, functions #1, #2, and #3 are used to open the mail
    account (this is all provided that maildirs are used, since the
    <i>Courier</i> mail server's IMAP, POP3, and webmail servers talk to
    maildirs only).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The authentication library therefore provides an
  authentication layer that cleanly separates the vague notion of
  an "E-mail address" and the actual files and directories where
  mail for this account goes. The <i>Courier</i> mail server provides
  several authentication modules. Not every authentication module
  will be compiled and installed on every system. Some
  authentication modules require external libraries to be present.
  The <code>configure</code> script inventories the system
  configuration, and tries to figure out which authentication
  modules are needed.</p>

  <p>Usually, this is an automatic process. Occasionally, some
  manual intervention will be necessary.</p>

  <h4><code>authpwd</code>, <code>authshadow</code>, and
  <code>authpam</code></h4>

  <p>These three authentication modules are used in the most simple
  environment - authentication based on the system password file.
  They use the traditional <code>pwd.h</code> and
  <code>group.h</code> library functions. Mail to
  <code>&lt;user@domain&gt;</code> is delivered to the system
  account <code>user</code>, in the default mailbox location
  specified in the <code>courierd</code> configuration file. The
  IMAP, POP3, and webmail servers assume that default mailbox is
  <code>$HOME/Maildir</code>. The only difference between these
  three authentication modules is that <code>authpwd</code> reads
  the account password from the <code>/etc/passwd</code> file,
  <code>authshadow</code> reads the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file,
  and <code>authpam</code> uses the PAM library to authenticate
  passwords. This actually allows account passwords to be read from
  sources other than the <code>passwd</code> or <code>shadow</code>
  files. For example, if the <code>pam_smb</code> PAM module is
  used, it may be possible to authenticate passwords against an NT
  domain controller, but this is really outside the scope of this
  document.</p>

  <p>If the <code>configure</code> finds that the system uses
  <code>PAM</code> for authentication, <code>authpam</code> will be
  automatically installed, and <code>authpwd</code> and
  <code>authshadow</code> will NOT be installed. This is because
  reading the <code>passwd</code> and <code>shadow</code> files is
  not recommended when PAM is used for authentication, since the
  <code>passwd</code> and <code>shadow</code> files may be (as an
  example) simply a text dump of the real account database, which
  is stored elsewhere.</p>

  <p>NOTE: PAM is only used for authenticating password. The
  <code>authpam</code> module still uses the <code>pwd.h</code> and
  <code>group.h</code> library to find the account's home directory
  and mailbox.</p>

  <h4><code>authuserdb/authcram</code></h4>

  <p>This is a poor man's virtual mail account implementation. The
  <code>authuserdb</code> module is accompanied by a set of Perl
  scripts that are used to map arbitrary E-mail addresses to
  arbitrary make-believe "home directories" and mailboxes. The
  <code>authuserdb</code> module is a convenient way to implement a
  comparatively small number of mail accounts without bothering to
  create real system accounts, or using a more complicated LDAP or
  MySQL-based account database.</p>

  <p>The E-mail addresses, the location of the corresponding
  mailboxes, and other miscellaneous information is kept in a set
  of plain text files. A couple of Perl scripts are provided to
  conveniently enter and edit the contents of the
  <code>userdb</code> text files, and compile them into a binary
  database format that's used directly to deliver to/read the
  mailbox for the corresponding E-mail address.</p>

  <p><code>userdb</code> is loosely based on the traditional
  passwd/shadow files. There are two binary database files, one
  world readable, the other not (that one contains just the
  passwords). Each "mail account" has the usual properties defined
  in the <code>userdb</code> database: name, "home directory", uid,
  gid, and password. This is basically an equivalent to the
  traditional <code>passwd</code> file, except that an efficient
  binary database format is used to search it.</p>

  <p>All the traditional account properties - the uid and the gid -
  are present, that doesn't mean that every <code>userdb</code>
  account has to have unique properties. The most typical
  environment allocates a single uid/gid for all mail accounts, and
  creates all mail accounts with the same uid/gid, but different
  pseudo-homedirs and mailboxes.</p>

  <p>The <code>userdb</code> database contains a couple of other
  fields that are not found in the traditional <code>passwd</code>
  file. The <code>mail</code> field specifies a non-default
  location of the mailbox for the account, and overrides the
  assumed default of $HOME/Maildir. The <code>quota</code> field is
  used for "Maildir quotas", a loosely-implemented cap on the
  maximum size of the given maildir. The usage of maildir quotas is
  described in the INSTALL file.</p>

  <p><code>userdb</code> records may include other arbitrary fields
  too. The <i>Courier</i> mail server will simply ignore them. They can
  be used to conveniently store system-specific custom
  information.</p>

  <p>The <code>authuserdb</code> module is designed to handle up to
  a couple of thousand mail accounts. Beyond that, more
  "heavyweight" modules should be used, such as
  <code>authldap</code> and <code>authmysql</code>. Although the
  binary <code>userdb</code> database is rather quick, creating the
  binary database from the original plain text files is a
  comparatively slow process, and it must be done every time any
  changes are made to the <code>userdb</code> files. The conversion
  from text to binary is done by a couple of Perl scripts. Perl is
  an interpreted language, and is comparatively slow.
  <code>userdb</code> is not meant to handle huge lists of
  accounts, so no attempt has been made to optimize the whole
  process.</p>

  <h4><code>authldap</code>, and <code>authmysql</code></h4>

  <p>These two modules are used to store all account information in
  an LDAP directory or a MySQL server. Except for the actual
  back-end, these two modules have similar functionality. Both of
  them have a corresponding configuration file which defines where
  the server is, and the name of the fields where the requisite
  information can be found. The <code>configure</code> script will
  automatically add these modules if it finds the requisite
  development libraries: OpenLDAP development libraries or MySQL
  development libraries.</p>

  <p>Note that it is not sufficient to have just the runtime
  support libraries available, in order to compile
  <code>authldap</code> or <code>authmysql</code>. Some operating
  system distributions provide separate "runtime" and "development"
  packages for OpenLDAP and MySQL. The "development" package will
  contain the necessary files to compile <code>authldap</code> and
  <code>authmysql</code>. Once compiled, the modules can be
  installed on any server that contains only the runtime support
  files.</p>

  <p>Normally, if the <code>configure</code> scripts detects that
  the development libraries is installed, the appropriate module
  will be automatically compiled and installed. However, for an
  external library to be detected, it must be installed wherever
  the C or the C++ compiler looks for libraries.</p>

  <p>The <i>Courier</i> mail server relies on the C or the C++ compiler
  to detect the availability of a particular library. Example: if
  OpenSSL is installed in the directory <code>/usr/local/ssl</code>
  chances are that the C or the C++ compiler does not usually
  search this directory for libraries or include files. Most C and
  C++ compilers search only the directories <code>/lib</code>,
  <code>/usr/lib</code>, and <code>/usr/include</code> (for include
  files).</p>

  <p>All C and C++ compilers allow you to specify any additional
  directories to search, beside the default ones. The configuration
  script uses the environment variables <code>CPPFLAGS</code>,
  <code>CFLAGS</code>, and <code>LDFLAGS</code> to pass extra
  options to the compiler's preprocessor, the compiler itself, and
  the linker.</p>

  <p>For example, if OpenSSL's include files are installed in the
  directory <code>/usr/local/ssl/include</code>, and OpenSSL
  libraries are installed in <code>/usr/local/ssl/lib</code>, the
  <code>gcc</code> compiler needs to have the
  <code>-I/usr/local/ssl/include</code> option for the
  preprocessor, and the <code>-L/usr/local/ssl/lib</code> option
  for the linker. So, to have the configuration script detect
  OpenSSL, use the following commands:</p>
  <pre>
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include"
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib"
export CPPFLAGS
export LDFLAGS
./configure [ options ]
</pre>

  <p>The same applies for OpenLDAP, MySQL, and any other library.
  The configuration script does not maintain a list of all the
  non-standard locations where various libraries get installed by
  default, because that's subject to change at any time. The
  configuration script expects that the compiler can find the
  development files by itself.</p>

  <h4><code>authcustom</code></h4>

  <p>This is a dummy authentication modules, it doesn't do
  anything. It is a placeholder to insert custom authentication
  code.</p>

  <h4><code>authdaemon</code></h4>

  <p><code>authdaemon</code> is a "metamodule". It is not a real
  authentication modules, but acts like one. When
  <code>authdaemon</code> is selected, the <code>authlib</code>
  authentication library compiles all the other authentication
  modules into a separate program, <code>authdaemond</code>, that
  runs as the background process. The <code>authdaemon</code>
  module receives all authentication requets, and forwards them to
  the <code>authdaemond</code>.</p>

  <p>This approach is used to optimize database-driven modules such
  as <code>authldap</code> or <code>authmysql</code>. When invoked
  separately, <code>authldap</code> must log in to the server,
  process the authentication requests, then disconnect. Lather,
  rinse, repeat.</p>

  <p>As part of the permanent <code>authdaemond</code> background
  process, these modules log in to the database server, and
  maintain a persistent long-running process, which is used to
  process a stream of authentication requests. The configuration
  file for the <code>authdaemond</code> process specifies the
  number of <code>authdaemond</code> processes that will be
  started. This allows the <i>Courier</i> mail server to handle heavy
  volumes of authentication requests.</p>

  <h4>Authentication module configuration</h4>

  <p>It is possible to have more than one authentication module
  configured. For example, using <code>authpam</code> to
  authenticate system accounts, and <code>authuserdb</code> to
  authenticate virtual mail accounts. The <code>configure</code>
  script inventories the system configuration and will often pick
  several authentication modules that can be used with the existing
  system configuration.</p>

  <p>There are two ways to disable unwanted authentication modules.
  The <code>configure</code> option
  <code>--without-<em>name</em></code> disables module
  <em>name</em>. Another way is to simply disable the
  authentication module at runtime. The configuration file for the
  main the <i>Courier</i> mail server, the IMAP, POP3, and webmail
  servers specifies which authentication modules the servers use.
  When <code>authdaemon</code> is installed, the
  <code>authdaemond</code> configuration file lists the active
  authentication modules. Removing the name of the authentication
  module from the list will effectively disable it.</p>

  <h3><a name="gdbmdb" id="gdbmdb">Q: Configuration script reports
  the following error, and stops: "Cannot find either the gdbm or
  the db library"</a></h3>

  <p>A: The <i>Courier</i> mail server requires either the GDBM library
  or the Berkeley DB library to be installed. If you have the
  library installed, it is possible that it is installed in a
  non-standard location. See "Q: I have OpenLDAP, or OpenSSL, or
  MySQL installed" for how to resolve this situation.</p>

  <h3>Q: Configuration script fails in the <code>gdbmobj</code> or
  <code>bdbobj</code> subdirectory.</h3>

  <p>A: There are two possible causes of this error:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A C++ compiler is not installed.</li>

    <li>The corresponding library is installed in a non-standard
    location.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Another possible reason for this error is that the GDBM or the
  Berkeley DB library is not installed in a directory that is
  searched by the C and C++ compilers, by default. See "Q: I have
  OpenLDAP, or OpenSSL, or MySQL installed" for how to resolve this
  situation.</p>

  <h3>Q: Cannot find the GDBM library during compilation</h3>

  <p>A: If you have <code>libgdbm.so</code> installed in
  <code>/usr/local/lib</code> and <code>gdbm.h</code> installed in
  <code>/usr/local/include</code>, it's possible that your compiler
  doesn't search those directories. Reconfigure your compiler to
  search those directories by default. Try setting
  <code>CPPFLAGS</code> and <code>LDFLAGS</code> when running
  configure:</p>
  <pre>
CPPFLAGS="-I /usr/local/include" \
   LDFLAGS="-L /usr/local/lib" ./configure [options]
</pre>

  <p>It is also possible that <code>libgdbm.so</code> is not found
  at runtime because your dynamic linker doesn't search
  <code>/usr/local/lib</code> either. You will have to reconfigure
  your dynamic linker.</p>

  <p>An alternative solution is to install soft links in
  <code>/usr/lib</code> and <code>/usr/include</code> to point to
  the GDBM library.</p>

  <h3><a name="solarisbug" id="solarisbug">Q: Compilation fails on
  Solaris in the waitlib subdirectory</a></h3>

  <p>A: Use <code>--with-waitfunc=wait3</code> option to configure.
  A better solution is to pester Sun to fix their kernel. Using
  this option is just a bandaid solution, and you might still
  experience runtime problems with zombie processes not being
  reaped, etc... One person reported that installing the fix for
  bug <code>"4220394 wait3 library function fails after 248
  days"</code> fixes this problem, someone else claimed that this
  continues to happen even after installing this patch.</p>

  <h2><a name="osx" id="osx">Compiling the <i>Courier</i> mail
  server-IMAP on OS/X</a></h2>

  <p>Set the RANLIB environment variable before running the
  <code>configure</code> script, as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>
RANLIB="ranlib -c"
export RANLIB
./configure [ options ]
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <h3><a name="makefail" id="makefail">Q: <code>make
  install-strip</code> fails</a></h3>

  <p>Use <code>make install</code> instead.</p>

  <h3>Q: <code>make check</code> fails</h3>

  <p>Use the GNU make.</p>

  <p><em>make check</em> will fail if
  <code>--enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs</code> option is
  selected. It's not a bug, it's a feature.</p>

  <h3><a name="tru64" id="tru64">Q: <tt>gmake check</tt> fails on
  Compaq Tru64 UNIX</a></h3>

  <p>A: A patchkit for Tru64 5.x that fixes this problem is
  scheduled to be released by Compaq in early spring 2002. Tru64
  4.x is not affected by this problem.</p>

  <h3><a name="rpm" id="rpm">Q: I don't know how to build the RPM
  packages as non-root</a></h3>

  <p>A: You should really go out and get a copy of "Maximum RPM".
  It's very out of date, but if you learn the basics, you'll be
  able to figure the rest out by yourself. The following
  instructions are applicable to RPM 3.0.4, or higher. First, you
  need to create a mirror image of the main RPM directory in your
  account:</p>
  <pre>
    mkdir $HOME/rpm
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/SOURCES
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/SPECS
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/BUILD
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/SRPMS
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/RPMS
    mkdir $HOME/rpm/RPMS/i386
</pre>

  <p>Use <code>sparc</code>, or <code>alpha</code>, or whatever's
  appropriate. Finally:</p>
  <pre>
    echo "%_topdir    $HOME/rpm" &gt;&gt; $HOME/.rpmmacros
</pre>

  <p>That's it, now you can build your RPMs:</p>
  <pre>
    rpm -ta courier-0.40.tar.bz2
</pre>

  <p>or,</p>
  <pre>
    rpmbuild -ta courier-0.40.tar.bz2   # For RPM 4.1, and higher (Red Hat 8.0)
</pre>

  <h3>Q: I want to change the options that the RPMs are built
  with</h3>

  <p>Building the RPMs directly from the source tarball uses the
  default options programmed into the tarball. Sometimes you may
  want to use different options. For example, you might want to
  enable fixes for certain bugs in some IMAP clients. Use the
  following procedure to build the RPMs with different options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Move the tarball to your <code>SOURCES</code>
    directory.</li>

    <li>Extract a single file from the tarball,
    <code>courier.spec</code>. This file is found at the top level
    of the source tree.</li>

    <li>Move <code>courier.spec</code> to your <code>SPECS</code>
    directory. Edit it and make whatever changes you need to
    make.</li>

    <li>Use that spec file to build your RPMs.</li>

    <li>You will have to repeat the procedure when you want to
    build packages from the next release. The spec file is subject
    to change, and there is no guarantee that a spec file from one
    release will still work for the next release.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ESMTP</h2>

  <h3><a name="esmtptimeout" id="esmtptimeout">Why are my e-mails
  taking so long to send?</a></h3>

  <p>Several things happen when the <i>Courier</i> mail server receives a
  connection on the SMTP port 25. Sometimes those things take an
  excessively long time to complete, and it seems that the <i>Courier</i>
  mail server answers port 25 connections after a long delay.</p>

  <p>This usually happens for all connections to port 25, but it's
  usually noticed when trying to send mail using a mail client
  that's set up to use a the <i>Courier</i> mail server server as a mail
  relay. Connections from other mail servers may experience similar
  delays, but they are less likely to be noticed. It's hard to
  ignore a mail client that does nothing, when it's commanded to
  send a message.</p>

  <p>When a new connection is received on port 25, with the default
  configuration the <i>Courier</i> mail server performs the following
  checks:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The connecting IP address is looked up in DNS.</li>

    <li>If the connecting IP address is resolved to a hostname, the
    hostname is looked up in DNS again, to see if it resolves to
    the connecting IP address.</li>

    <li>The connecting IP address is queried using the <a target=
    "_blank" href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1413.txt">IDENT
    protocol</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The results obtained from these queries will be recorded in
  the <code>Received:</code> header of any message received from
  the connecting IP address.</p>

  <p>A non-responding DNS server may result in lengthy connection
  delays, as the DNS query times out (which may take several
  minutes). A non-responding server for the connecting IP address's
  netblock will probably not be a major problem, since the
  intermediate DNS resolvers should quickly failover to any
  functioning backup authoritative servers for the connecting IP
  address, or its hostname. A bigger problem is when the local DNS
  resolver, listed in /etc/resolv.conf goes down. This will result
  in a certain percentage of all incoming connections experiencing
  major delays.</p>

  <p>A local, or an intermediate firewall may also drop IDENT
  packets. IDENT is a fairly old protocol whose original purpose is
  to identify individual users of a shared network server. Some
  proxies may also use IDENT to identify the original source of a
  proxied connection. However, since IDENT is an old, and not a
  very well known protocol, some poorly-written firewalls may not
  recognize the protocol, and bit-bucket IDENT connection requests.
  An IDENT request times out after 30 seconds.</p>

  <p>When investigating connection delays:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Check each server listed in <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>.
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> The <i>Courier</i> mail server does not read
    the <code>hosts</code> file. It needs a DNS server (although it
    is possible to have a working the <i>Courier</i> mail server
    configuration in a completely DNS-free environment, this
    excersize requires changing many configuration files, and
    perhaps will be its own FAQ entry some day).</li>

    <li>Try to resolve the connecting IP address in DNS, backwards
    and forwards.</li>

    <li>Conduct a search for any misbehaving firewall between the
    server, and the connecting IP address.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>As a last resort, both of these lookups can be turned off. Add
  the <code>-nodnslookup</code> and <code>-noidentlookup</code>
  options to TCPDOPTS, in the esmtpd configuration file (usually
  <code>/usr/lib/courier/etc/esmtpd</code>). Example:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><code>TCPDOPTS="-nodnslookup -noidentlookup"</code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There'll probably be an existing TCPDOPTS setting in there.
  Add the whitespace-delimited options to anything that's already
  in there.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This should only be done as a last
    resort, if there are no options left. The information gathered
    by the queries may prove to be essential in investigating
    high-level mail delivery-related issues. If a realization hits
    that the DNS or IDENT information is needed to track down a
    particular piece of mail, it'll be already too late. It
    should've been there right from the start.</p>

  <h3><a name="esmtperr" id="esmtperr">Q: The <i>Courier</i> mail server
  rejects mail with the following error:</a></h3>

  <blockquote>
    <code>MX records for $domain violate section 3.3.9 of RFC
    1035</code>

    <p>or</p>

    <p><code>This domain's DNS violates RFC 1035.</code></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><code>[PP]</code> Cause: Invalid DNS MX Records for that
  domain</p>

  <p>Solution: Contact sysadmin for that domain and advise to fix
  their DNS.</p>

  <p>A common problem appears to be that an MX record will point to
  an IP address rather than a domain name (FQDN) as follows:</p>

  <p>INCORRECT MX RECORD:</p>
  <pre>
domain.com    preference = 20, mail exchanger = 192.68.0.10
</pre>

  <p>CORRECT MX RECORD:</p>
  <pre>
domain.com    preference = 20, mail exchanger = mail.domain.com
</pre>

  <p>Temporary Solution: Put the offending domain into the
  <code>esmtproutes</code> file and point it to that domain's mail
  exchanger host. Doing so bypasses checking the domains MX or A
  records and mail is sent directly to the relay specified in
  esmtproutes. Reference: man <a href=

  <h3>Q: The <i>Courier</i> mail server rejects mail with the following
  error:</h3>

  <blockquote>
    <code>517 Syntax error - your mail software violates RFC
    821.</code>
  </blockquote>

  <p><code>[PP]</code> Cause: Most often generated by WinCE gizmos.
  Several reasons, most common missing required &lt;&gt;
  surrounding the MAIL FROM: or RCPT TO: verbs</p>

  <p><code>[SV]</code> This problem is apparently present in the
  Microsoft Outlook client too. See item #7 in <a target="_blank"
  href=
  "http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q180/4/84.ASP"><code>
  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q180/4/84.ASP</code></a>.
  Note: contrary to the information in that article, this address
  specification format is REQUIRED by <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc821.txt">RFC 821</a>, and
  Microsoft is simply ignoring another Internet standard, here.</p>

  <p><code>[PP]</code> Solution: The usual solution for a 517 is to
  tell people to explicitly put &lt;&gt; around all E-mail
  addresses. That is, program their WinCE gizmo to believe that
  their return address is "&lt;user@domain.com&gt;" instead of
  "user@domain.com", and have them enter each recipient's address
  in a similar way.</p>

  <h3>Q: The <i>Courier</i> mail server delivers ESMTP mail with a
  strange error message:</h3>

  <p>Mail received by the received is replaced by the following
  text, with the original message attached.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><tt>I received the following message for delivery to your
    address. Unfortunately, the sender's mail software did not
    properly format the following message properly, in accordance
    with Internet mail formatting protocols, and I can only deliver
    mail which has been properly formatted according to Internet
    standards. Instead of returning the following message as
    undeliverable, it is saved, in its original form, in the
    following attachment, which you can open with any editor or
    word processor.</tt></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><code>[PP] [Sam]</code> Cause: Various bugs in poorly written
  software that generates invalid MIME-formatted messages. Previous
  versions of the <i>Courier</i> mail server used to automatically return
  mis-formatted mail as undeliverable. Starting with version
  0.36.1, mis-formatted mail is replaced by this canned message
  text, and the original message is attached as plain text.</p>

  <p>Solution: for now, manually edit
  <code>SubmitFile::MessageEnd()</code> in
  <code>courier/submit2.C</code>, and remove the code that reports
  both 8-bit related errors, <code>RFC2045_ERR8BITHEADER</code> and
  <code>RFC2045_ERR8BITCONTENT</code> (the first and the third
  error message).</p>

  <p>This will suppress the error and accept the garbage mail, but
  expect random mail access problems. Certain versions of Outlook
  have known bugs handling misformatted mail, so you're on your
  own.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Do not remove the code that reports RFC2045_ERR2COMPLEX,
  this error indicates a denial-of-service attack.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Removing the check for RFC2045_ERRBADBOUNDARY suppresses
  the second error message, however think long and hard before you
  do this. You are virtually guaranteed to end up with corrupted
  MIME mail if this check is removed!</p>

  <h3><a name="virtual" id="virtual">Q: How do I implement virtual
  domain hosting?</a></h3>

  <p>There are literally a dozen different ways to do it. If you
  are comfortable with how virtual domains are implemented by
  Qmail, you can do something similar with the <i>Courier</i> mail
  server. If you are used to implementing virtual domains with
  sendmail, you'll be able to do something similar too.
  Additionally, you can use LDAP directories or MySQL databases to
  store your mail account configuration. Or, you can simply enter
  virtual account information in text files, and run a script to
  convert the text file database to a binary GDBM or DB database
  that the <i>Courier</i> mail server can use to map arbitrary mail
  addresses to home directories and mailboxes. In all cases, the
  same configuration is automatically shared by ESMTP, IMAP, POP3,
  and webmail components. They all use the same authentication
  back-end.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> in all cases you are still responsible
  for creating the home directories and/or mailboxes for each
  account, with the appropriate ownership and permissions. You will
  still need to do that in all cases.</p>

  <h4>Using USERDB</h4>

  <p>The <code>authuserdb</code> authentication module is included
  by default. To use it, create a file or a subdirectory named
  <code>userdb</code> in the configuration directory (the default
  location is <code>/usr/lib/courier/etc</code>, but that may vary
  on your platform). If <code>userdb</code> is a subdirectory, the
  contents of files in that subdirectory are simply concatenated.
  Use the following commands to create a virtual account:</p>
  <pre>
userdb john@example.com set home=/home/virtual/example.com/john \
             uid=999 gid=999
          
userdbpw | userdb john@example.com set systempw
</pre>

  <p>If <code>userdb</code> is a subdirectory instead of a file,
  replace "john@example.com" with
  "<em>filename</em>/john@example.com".</p>

  <p>On systems that use MD5 password hashes, instead of crypt-ed
  passwords, specify the <code>-md5</code> option to
  <code>userdbpw</code>.</p>

  <p>The home directory of this virtual account must now be
  created, as well as its default system mailbox (usually
  <code>$HOME/Maildir</code>).</p>

  <p>When a virtual account does not really have a home directory,
  just the system mailbox, set both the <code>home</code> and
  <code>mail</code> fields to the same pathname:</p>
  <pre>
userdb john@example.com set home=/home/virtual/example.com/john \
             mail=/home/virtual/example.com/john \
             uid=999 gid=999
          
</pre>

  <p>In this case <code>/home/virtual/example.com/john</code> is
  the system mailbox.</p>

  <p>Run the <code>makeuserdb</code> command to rebuild the
  <code>userdb</code> database.</p>

  <p>Finally, <code>example.com</code> must be configured as a
  virtual domain. Edit the <code>hosteddomains</code> configuration
  file, add <code>example.com</code> to the file, then run
  <code>makehosteddomains</code>. See <a href=
  "courier.html">courier(8)</a> for more information.</p>

  <p><code>userdb</code> can completely replace the functionality
  of the traditional <code>/etc/passwd</code> file. With a large
  passwd file, converting the flat text file to a fast database
  file can greatly improve performance. The <code>pw2userdb</code>
  script convert <code>/etc/passwd</code> to <code>userdb</code>
  format.</p>

  <h4>Qmail-style virtual domains</h4>

  <p>Append the following to the <code>aliases</code> configuration
  file:</p>
  <pre>
@example.com: john
</pre>

  <p>If <code>aliases</code> is a subdirectory, append this to any
  file in the subdirectory (or create a new one). In all cases, run
  <code>makealiases</code> for the change to take effect.</p>

  <p>Mail to <code>anything@example.com</code> gets delivered to
  local address <code>john-anything</code>. The local
  <code>john</code> account may install <a href=
  "dot-courier.html">dot-courier(5)</a> delivery instructions for
  any particular <code>anything</code> address.</p>

  <h4>Sendmail-style virtual domains</h4>

  <p>Append the following to the <code>aliases</code> configuration
  file:</p>
  <pre>
john@example.com: john1
</pre>

  <p>If <code>aliases</code> is a subdirectory, append this to any
  file in the subdirectory (or create a new one). In all cases, run
  <code>makealiases</code> for the change to take effect.</p>

  <p>Mail to <code>john@example.com</code> will be delivered to the
  local account <code>john1</code>.</p>

  <h4>Using <code>LDAP</code> or <code>MySQL</code> back-ends</h4>

  <p>Virtual domains can also be supported by storing the account
  information in an LDAP directory or a MySQL database. This is
  implemented by installing the <code>authldap</code> and
  <code>authmysql</code> authentication module.</p>

  <p>It will be necessary to initialize <code>hosteddomains</code>,
  and run <code>makehosteddomains</code> in order to configure the
  <i>Courier</i> mail server to pass virtual domains to the local mail
  module. Additionally, <code>authldap</code> and
  <code>authmysql</code> come with their corresponding
  configuration files, <code>authldaprc</code> and
  <code>authmysqlrc</code>, that specify the gory details such as
  the location of the back-end server, and the name of the tables
  or records involved. Consult that configuration file for more
  information.</p>

  <h3><a name="linkerr" id="linkerr">Q: The <i>Courier</i> mail server
  keeps restarting every minute, and there are weird syslog
  messages about "unsafe" hard links</a></h3>

  <p>You are running an operating system kernel that's been altered
  with one of several nonstandard modifications that aim to improve
  system security by rejecting certain kinds of operating system
  calls. You will need to disable these non-standard patches. They
  completely modify the traditional file permission semantics, in
  the name of security. This breaks the <i>Courier</i> mail server, whose
  security model is based on traditional filesystem
  permissions.</p>

  <h3><a name="backupmx" id="backupmx">How to configure the
  <i>Courier</i> mail server to be a backup MX for a domain</a></h3>

  <p>To configure a the <i>Courier</i> mail server server as a backup MX,
  meaning that the <i>Courier</i> mail server receives mail for
  <code>@domain.com</code>, and forwards it to the primary MX
  server for domain.com when it becomes available (presumably the
  primary MX server is not available at this moment):</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Put <code>domain.com</code> into the
    <code>esmtpacceptmailfor</code> configuration file (or the
    <code>esmtpacceptmailfor.dir</code> directory, then run
    <code>makeacceptmailfor</code>).</li>

    <li>Insert a DNS MX record. The MX record must have a higher
    priority than <code>domain.com</code>'s primary MX.
    Furthermore, the hostname in the MX record must be one of the
    hostnames in the <code>locals</code> configuration file. For
    example:
      <pre>
domain.com      MX 10  primary.domain.com
domain.com      MX 20  backupmx.domain.com
primary.domain.com  A 192.168.0.4
backupmx.domain.com A 192.168.0.5        # IP address of the backup MX server

locals:
backupmx.domain.com

esmtpacceptmailfor:
domain.com
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>It is also possible to have backupmx.domain.com listed at
    the same MX priority as the primary MX. If so, it will also be
    necessary to explicitly initialize the esmtproutes
    configuration file:
      <pre>
domain.com: [192.168.0.4]
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>IMAP</h2>

  <h3><a name="imapbugs" id="imapbugs">Q: StarOffice's IMAP client
  doesn't work, Messenger's IMAP client reports command errors when
  new messages arrive</a></h3>

  <p>A: Both IMAP clients do not correctly implement certain parts
  of IMAP4rev1. Rerun configure, and use
  <code>--enable-workarounds-for-imap-client-bugs</code> option.
  Note that make check will fail when this option is used.</p>

  <h3><a name="namespace" id="namespace">Q: Can't create folders,
  only subfolders of INBOX</a></h3>

  <p>This is a configuration issue with your mail client. IMAP
  servers are free to use any folder namespace arrangement that's
  technically convenient for them. The <i>Courier</i> mail server uses
  "INBOX." as the namespace for private folders, and "shared." as
  the namespace for public, shared, folders. The IMAP NAMESPACE
  extension (see <a target="_blank" href=
  "http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2342.txt"><code>http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2342.txt</code></a>)
  allows IMAP clients to automatically discover where the server
  creates folders, and your IMAP client should implement it.</p>

  <p>This should be completely transparent to you, if your IMAP
  client properly uses the <code>NAMESPACE</code> extension. If
  your IMAP client were to automatically take advantage of
  self-configuration features offered by RFC 2060 and RFC 2342, it
  would automatically discover, without any additional
  configuration from the user, that:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The folder namespace hierarchy separator is the .
    character</li>

    <li>Private folders are stored underneath the
    "<code>INBOX.</code>" hierarchy</li>

    <li>Public folders are stored underneath the
    "<code>shared.</code>" hierarchy</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you have to explicitly create folders that are subfolders
  of INBOX, or if you explicitly have to name that
  "<code>INBOX.foldername</code>", this is due to your IMAP client
  not being able to configure itself accordingly.</p>

  <p>A: Correct. IMAP servers are free to define any root of the
  folder namespace tree that's convenient for them. The <i>Courier</i>
  mail server's IMAP server uses INBOX as the folder namespace
  root, rather than the root hierarchy itself. The <i>Courier</i> mail
  server supports the <code>NAMESPACE</code> IMAP extension which
  allows compliant IMAP clients to automatically configure
  themselves so that the folder namespace root is transparent.
  Submit an enhancement request to have your IMAP client gracefully
  handle the folder namespace root.</p>

  <h3>Q: The IMAP server doesn't run at bootup</h3>

  <p>A: Check the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The entry for the IMAP port is not in
    <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code>.<br /></li>

    <li>If you're using the example system V init script,
    IMAPDSTART is set to YES in the <code>imapd</code>
    configuration file (usually
    <code>/usr/lib/courier/etc/imapd</code>).</li>

    Check that <code>authdaemond</code> is running.</li>

    <li>Your authentication modules are properly configured. Some
    authentication modules have additional configuration files
    (<code>authldap</code> and <code>authmysql</code>). If you're
    using <code>authpam</code>, you need to configure your PAM
    library to authenticate the "<em>imap</em>" service. This is a
    separate task, and is specific to your PAM library and
    operating system.</li>

    <li>You are using a database-based back-end, such as LDAP or
    MySQL, and the back-end server is down.</li>

    <li>You're using maildirs. The <i>Courier</i> mail server's IMAP

  it?</a></h3>

  <p>This means that the <i>Courier</i> mail server was compiled with
  File Alteration Monitor (FAM), but FAM is not running, or is not
  configured. If you have FAM installed you can add it to a
  runlevel and start it. Some FAM configuration use portmapper, so
  you will need to have portmap running also. You can also see "man

  <h2>Webmail</h2>

  <h3><a name="webmailcreate" id="webmailcreate">Q: How do I create
  new system accounts via the webmail server?</a></h3>

  <p>A: Write your own CGI script for this. Not everyone wants this
  ability, plus with all the different authentication module there
  are literally dozens of different ways accounts can be set up,
  and there's no way to provide a uniform interface for this
  purpose.</p>

  <h3>Q: I changed the system password for an account, but the
  webmail password hasn't changed?</h3>

  <p>A: Mainly for the same reason, there's no uniform way to
  change system passwords, so the webmail server maintains its own
  passwords, which are initialized from the system password. You
  can reconfigure the <i>Courier</i> mail server with the
  <code>--enable-webpass=no</code> flag (see INSTALL), and lose the
  ability to change passwords in the webmail interface, so all
  password changes must now be done on the system level.</p>

    <li>Before sending a question, check it to make sure that your

    thumb), to the list. Put it somewhere - on the web or on a FTP
    server - and include a link in your message instead.</li>

    <li>Always mention what you've already tried to do in order to
    fix the problem. People are more likely to help you if they
    know that you've made some effort to figure it out by yourself,
    and you are only asking for help after running into a dead
    end.</li>

    <li>If you do not get an answer in one hour, don't resend your
    message. If people open their mailbox and see five copies of
    the same message, they'll be ignored. Have patience. Either
    wait some more, or accept it as a fact of life. Try again to
    figure out the answer on your own. You can certainly ask again
    after you've tried to figure it out once more, and still didn't
    get anywhere. Don't just write again, and simply say that it
    still doesn't work. Provide some additional information,
    showing what else you've tried to do, to no avail.</li>

  <h3><a name="vdomains" id="vdomains">Q: Using virtual
  domains</a></h3>

  <p>There are several ways to implement virtual mailboxes, to
  address different situations and environments. The simplest case
  involved simply redirecting certain mail addresses to a local
  mailbox:</p>
  <pre>
user@domain.com: localuser
</pre>

  <p>This entry in the <code>aliases</code> configuration file (run
  the <code>makealiases</code> script after editing
  <code>aliases</code>) causes mail for &lt;user@domain.com&gt; to
  be delivered to <code>localuser</code>, which must be an existing
  system account. If IMAP/POP3/Webmail access has been configured,
  it is necessary to log in as <code>localuser</code> to pick up
  this mail.</p>

  <p>A slightly different syntax in <code>aliases</code> results in
  mail for an entire mail domain to be controlled by a local system
  account:</p>
  <pre>
@domain.com: localuser
</pre>

  <p>Here, any mail address &lt;foo@domain.com&gt; will be
  redirected to the local address &lt;localuser-foo&gt;. Note, the
  address is &lt;localuser-foo&gt;, not &lt;localuser&gt;. This
  means that the account owner &lt;localuser&gt; gets to control
  the mailboxes in this domain. In this case, the file
  <code>$HOME/.courier-foo</code> will control disposition of mail
  addressed to <code>foo@domain.com</code>. See the <a href=
  "dot-courier.html">dot-courier(5)</a> man page for more
  information. In this case, there is no default way to access mail
  to various mailboxes via IMAP/POP3/Webmail. If
  <code>$HOME/.courier-default</code> is used to deliver all mail
  for this domain to the default mailbox for the
  <code>localuser</code> account, mail can be read via
  IMAP/POP3/Webmail by loggin in as <code>localuser</code>.</p>

  <p>The other way to implement virtual domains is by using a
  custom authentication back-end, such as LDAP, MySQL, and
  PostgreSQL, to explicitly administer virtual domains. The first
  step is to add <code>domain.com</code> to the
  <code>hosteddomains</code> configuration file, and run the
  <code>makehosteddomains</code> script. This tells the <i>Courier</i>
  mail server to deliver mail for this domain locally. The next
  step is to appropriately configure the authentication library,
  and define the valid mailboxes in this domain. See the <a href=
  "authlib.html">authlib(8)</a> man page for information on setting
  up the various authentication back-ends. The authentication
  back-ends that can support virtual domains are LDAP, MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, and userdb (also vchkpw, but that requires some
  external configuration).</p>

  <p>Note that the <i>Courier</i> mail server does not automatically
  create the maildirs for virtual mail accounts. After setting up a
  virtual mail account it is still necessary to create and
  initialize the virtual home directory, and the virtual maildir
  directory, with the correct permission and ownership.</p>

  <p>Most authentication modules require their own specific
  configuration files to be initialized. Most authentication
  modules also require that they be compiled into the
  <code>authdaemon</code> authentication proxy. This means that it
  will be necessary to arrange to have <code>authdaemond</code>
  started at system startup. See the <a href=
  "authlib.html">authlib(8)</a> man page for more information.</p>

  <h3><a name="fetchmail" id="fetchmail">Q: Using
  <code>fetchmail</code></a></h3>

  <p>Since the <i>Courier</i> mail server provides both IMAP and POP3
  services, nothing unusual is required to download mail from a the
  <i>Courier</i> mail server-hosted mailbox, using either protocol. Here
  is a suggested <code>fetchmail.rc</code> configuration file to
  download mail from an external mail account into a local mailbox.
  For readability, some long lines below have been split across
  multiple lines, and they should be manually combined. Insert your
  account information in the appropriate place, and run
  <code>fetchmail</code> from the account's crontab:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>

mda "/relay/bin/env USER=relay HOME=/relay/home/username \
   DEFAULT=./ SENDER=%F RECIPIENT=%T \
   /usr/lib/courier/bin/maildrop -V 1 -f '%F' /home/username/.mailfilter"
</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This example is for a basic system that uses traditional
  system accounts, and with an existing
  <code>$HOME/.mailfilter</code> (which can be generated via the
  webmail server). This can be used with virtual accounts, provided
  that additional steps are added to run maildrop under the correct
  system uid/gid, and the explicit pathname to the virtual
  account's <code>.mailfilter</code> is provided, and that the
  virtual account's <code>MAILDIR/mailfilterfilterconfig</code> is
  manually initialized to contain absolute pathnames (so that the
  generated <code>.mailfilter</code> file itself uses absolute
  paths).</p>

  <p>This is a simple example that downloads one external mailbox
  to a local mailbox. Some external mail providers offer a service
  to deliver all mail for an entire domain into a single mailbox.
  This example will also work for downloading all such mail into a
  single local mailbox. This approach cannot be reliable modified
  to distribute domain mail to multiple local mailboxes, no matter
  what anyone else tells you, even though <code>fetchmail</code>
  contains facilities for doing so. If that's what you want to do,
  have your mail delivered by ESMTP or UUCP. Delivering mail to a
  mailbox automatically discards all the required recipient
  information, and by redistributing mail locally you're going to
  attempt to reconstruct this information from mail headers. This
  is never going to be a 100% reliable process, and unless you
  fully understand all these issues, you're likely to end up with
  occasional mail loops and bounces, which will annoy many people.
  You've been warned.</p>
