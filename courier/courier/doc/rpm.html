  <h1>Building <em>Courier</em> mail server RPMs</h1>

  <p>You can build binary <em>Courier</em> mail server RPMs directly from
  the tarball, using RPM version 4.0.2 or higher. For example:</p>
  <pre>
rpmbuild -ta courier-<em>version</em>.tar.bz2
</pre>

  <p>Because the RPMs can be built directly from the tarball,
  binary RPMs will not be distributed separately.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>

    <p>The first attempt to build binary RPMs will likely result in
    an error message requesting additional RPMs to be installed
    first, such as the LDAP server, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases,
    and various other development libraries.</p>

    <p><span style="color: #ff4040">Do not blow off these
    requirements, and attempt to hack your way around them.</span>
    Install the required RPMs, and try again. These RPMs are
    required to build the full complement of the <em>Courier</em> mail
    server packages, and they may be removed after building the
    <em>Courier</em> mail server.</p>

    <p>Parts of the <em>Courier</em> mail server that use these optional
    RPMs will be built into separate, optional subpackages, and
    will not be required to run the <em>Courier</em> mail server. The
    optional RPMs must be installed only for the duration of the
    build process.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Note that the <em>Courier</em> mail server does not allow itself to be
  built as root. A single mistake -- especially when trying to
  build a system-level utility -- can have serious consequences.
  Therefore the configuration script won't let you. There's an
  undocumented flag to disable the check, for folks who don't make
  mistakes :-) See the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for instructions
  on how to configure RPM to build packages as non-root.</p>

  <p>Building the RPM packages yourself will also result in the
  packages being customized for your system. This procedure builds
  the following packages:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>courier.rpm</code> - the base mail server.</li>

    <li><code>courier-smtpauth.rpm</code> - install this package to
    enable authenticated ESMTP, in the ESMTP server.</li>

    <li><code>courier-ldap.rpm</code> - module to authenticate
    against an LDAP directory. Install this module if you would
    like to use an LDAP directory to authenticate and manage mail
    accounts. LDAP support requires the OpenLDAP library to be
    installed. If OpenLDAP development libraries are not installed,
    this package will be empty.</li>

    <li><code>courier-mysql.rpm</code> - module to authenticate
    using a MySQL database. Install this module if you would like
    to use a MySQL database to authenticate and manage mail
    accounts. If MySQL development libraries are not installed,
    this package will be empty.</li>

    <li><code>courier-pgsql.rpm</code> - module to authenticate
    using a PostgreSQL database. Install this module if you would
    like to use a PostgreSQL database to authenticate and manage
    mail accounts. If PostgreSQL development libraries are not
    installed, this package will be empty.</li>

    <li><code>courier-fax-<em>version</em>--1.%{_arch}.rpm</code> -
    several supporting scripts for sending E-mails by fax.</li>

    <li><code>courier-pop3d.rpm</code> - the POP3 server.</li>

    <li><code>courier-imapd.rpm</code> - the IMAP server.</li>

    <li><code>courier-webmail.rpm</code> - the webmail server.</li>

    <li><code>courier-webadmin.rpm</code> - the web-based
    administration tool (just the <code>cgi-bin</code> wrapper,
    actually, the remaining files are installed by other
    packages).</li>

    <li><code>courier-maildrop.rpm</code> - <em>maildrop</em> mail
    filter (required if you want to implement mail filtering).</li>

    <li><code>courier-mlm.rpm</code> - the <em>couriermlm</em>
    mailing list manager.</li>

    <li><code>courier-sendmail-wrapper.rpm</code> - install this
    package to create soft links from
    <code>/usr/bin/sendmail</code>, <code>/usr/lib/sendmail</code>,
    and several other popular places, to the <em>Courier</em> mail server's
    sendmail wrapper. This package will not be created on Red Hat
    7.3 and later, which uses the Debian-derived alternatives
    mechanism. The alternatives mechanism will be incorporated into
    the main <em>Courier</em> mail server package.</li>

    <li><code>courier-maildrop-wrapper.rpm</code> - install this
    package to create soft links in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
    subdirectory, for applications which expect to find
    <code>maildrop</code> in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code>
    directory. <code>maildrop</code> is also available as a
    standalone package, which normally installs in the
    <code>/usr/local/bin</code> subdirectory. The <em>Courier</em> mail
    server includes an integrated version of <code>maildrop</code>,
    and you can install this package to allow applications that are
    configured for the standalone <code>maildrop</code> version to
    use the <em>Courier</em> mail server's integrated version instead.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> these packages are built with certain
  directories in a non-default location. Specifically, the
  configuration files are installed in <code>/etc/courier</code>,
  the mail spool is installed in <code>/var/spool/courier</code>,
  and the manual pages are installed directly in
  <code>/usr/man</code>. Other configuration settings are left at
  their defaults. If you need to change the defaults, you will have
  to build your own packages.</p>

  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> the first time the system boots after
  installing the the <em>Courier</em> mail server RPM, the system may pause
  for several minutes at the "Starting The <em>Courier</em> mail server"
  prompt. That's because the startup script automatically creates
  test SSL certificates the first time the script is executed
  (provided that SSL support is available). This can take as much
  as 5-6 minutes on a slow machine. Subsequent starts should take
  only a few seconds. Have patience. Also note that the main
  <em>Courier</em> mail server RPM has the ESMTP server turned off. You
  must manually enable receiving mail via ESMTP by editing the
  <code>esmtpd</code> configuration file.</p>
