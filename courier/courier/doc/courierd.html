  <h2><code>courierd</code> daemon process</h2>

  <h3>Configuration files</h3>The following files are present in
  the <code>local/config</code> subdirectory.

  <p>The following configuration files are specific to the main
  <code>courierd</code> daemon. Module-specific configuration files
  are defined elsewhere.</p>

  <p><code>me</code> - if present, specifies the hostname of the
  machine, and used instead of <code>gethostname()</code>. Note
  that this is also used by submit. If The <em>Courier</em> mail server's
  installation directory is exported to clusters, you must arrange
  for a different <code>local/config/me</code> file for each
  machine in the cluster. One way to do so is to have
  <code>local/config/me</code> set as a soft link to /etc/HOSTNAME,
  which on each machine contains its host name.</p>

  <p><code>locals</code> - all the possible domains that are
  recognized as local. Text file, one domain per line. Defaults to
  me.&nbsp; This is used by the locals module, and by submit.</p>

  <p><code>queuetime</code> - how long The <em>Courier</em> mail server
  keeps trying to deliver a message, before returning it as
  undeliverable.&nbsp; Default is one week.</p>

  <p><code>warntime</code> - if a message is undeliverable for this
  long, send a warning message to the sender. Set to 0, in order to
  disable.&nbsp; Default is four hours.</p>

  <p><code>sizelimit</code> - maximum size of a message, in bytes.
  <code>submit</code> rejects longer messages.</p>

  <p><code>sizecheck</code> - contains three numbers: b i s. submit
  will return a temporary error indication and reject a submission
  if there are less than b free blocks, or i free inodes, on the
  mail filesystem. As submit receives the message, it will check
  the status of the filesystem every s bytes, and will immediately
  stop if the available free space falls below the set limits. If
  not specified, the limits are 500 blocks, 20 inodes, and 128K
  bytes. Also note that sometimes the actual amount of free disk
  blocks has to be twice as much, if <code>submit</code> decides to
  rewrite the message to convert to/from quoted printable encoding,
  or to add MIME headers.</p>

  <p><code>batchsize</code> - maximum number of recipients per
  message. submit splits longer recipient lists into separate
  messages. If absent, defaults to 100.</p>

  <p><code>queuelo</code> - <code>courierd</code> output queue low
  watermark. If absent, defaults to the sum of <b>MAXDELS</b> of
  all output modules. This number should be the minimum value for
  queuelo. The minimum value for <code>queuelo</code> is 20.</p>

  <p><code>queuehi</code> - <code>courierd</code> output queue high
  watermark. If absent, defaults to <b>queuelo</b> * 2, not to
  exceed <b>queuelo</b> + 1000. Must greater than
  <b>queuelo</b>.</p>

  <p><code>respawnlo</code> - do not respawn <code>courierd</code>
  second process more often than this time interval. The contents
  of this file is a single number following by 'h' for hours or 'd'
  for days. If this file does not exist, the <code>respawnlo</code>
  is set for one hour.</p>

  <p><code>respawnhi</code> - respawn <code>courierd</code> at
  least this often. Helps to cut down on memory fragmentation. The
  contents of this file is a single number following by 'h' for
  hours or 'd' for days. If this file does not exist, the
  <code>respawnhi</code> is set for seven days.</p>

  <p><code>bouncefrom</code> - what to put in the From: header on
  bounces</p>

  <h2><code>courierd</code> - process A - startup process</h2>

  <h3><code>courierd</code> startup activity</h3>A) chdirs to
  ${COURIER_HOME}. Disassociates from controlling terminal. Closes
  stdin/stdout/stderr, reopens stdin to <code>/dev/null</code>,
  stdout to <code>/dev/console</code>., and stderror to
  <code>logger</code>, Resets umask to 007. Forks, parent exits,
  child continues to run, becomes the first <code>courierd</code>
  daemon process, process A.

  <p>B) main starts all output modules. A separate pipe to each
  output module's stdin. Shared pipe from all output modules'
  stdout.</p>

  <p>C) main setgids and setuids itself to mail.</p>

  <p>D) main creates another pipe, then forks the second
  <code>courierd</code> daemon process, process B.</p>

  <p>E) main waits for any child process to terminate. If main
  receives a SIGHUP, main sighups process B.</p>

  <p>F) if process B terminates with a zero exit, main respawns it
  again, and logs the event to syslog.</p>

  <p>G) All other signals are logged to syslog, resulting in
  termination.</p>

  <p>H) Non-zero exit codes are logged, process A waits a minute,
  then respawns process B.</p>

  <p>I) each time main forks process B, main executes tmp directory
  cleanup (see submit process).</p>

  <h3><code>courierd</code> - process B</h3>A) Receipt of a SIGHUP
  sets a boolean flag called 'termination_flag'. This is logged.

  <p>B) Allocate queuehi msgq structures.</p>

  <p>C) Open all shared module libraries.</p>

  <p>D) Open <code>queue/trigger</code> for reading.</p>

  <p>E) Remove all empty directories in <code>local/msgq</code> and
  <code>local/msgs</code>.</p>

  <p>F) <b>Queue scan</b>.</p>

            <p>E) Add the msgq structure to the queue list, sorted

            hdlvrpfirst/last list from the tail end, looking for a
            host with a 0 dlvrcount and either a null pendinglist
            pointer, or whose pendelinfo's first recipient has a
            later timestamp than the new control file. If all hosts
            have a non-0 dlvrcount, create a new pendelinfo, add it
            to pendelinfo_list, add this rcptinfo * to pendelinfo's
            recipient_list (sorted by nextdel). If found one with a
            0 dlvrcount, set pendelinfo-&gt;hostp to null (if

  <h3><code>courierd</code> - process B - main loop</h3>A)
  <code>courierd</code> scans tmp directory for new messages (see
  submit process, above). When a new message is found, the message
  and control files are moved to local/msgs, and the control file
  is linked to local/msgq, with the current time set as the next
  scheduled delivery time. If the termination flag is NOT set,
  <b>add this control file to the queue</b>.

  <p>B) If the termination flag is not set, and there are no
  pending deliveries, check the process starting time. If the
  process has been running for at least respawnlo period of time,
  set the termination flag.</p>

  <p>C) If the process has been running for at least respawnhi
  period of time, set the termination flag unconditionally.</p>

  <p>D) If the termination flag is not set, and the queue scan flag
  is set, do a <b>queue scan</b>. If there are any control files in
  the local/tmp directory, go back to step A.</p>

  <p>E) If the termination flag is set, wait until a <b>delivery
  completion notice is received</b>. If there are no pending
  deliveries, terminate the process normally.</p>

  <p>F) Wait until any of the following events: <b>delivery
  completion notice</b>, new message notification from
  queue/trigger, if there are delivery attempts scheduled for a
  future time, wait until the timer expires. Check the time this
  process was started. If respawnlo interval has not passed, wait
  until respawnlo interval passes.</p>

  <p>G) End of file indication from process A causes an immediate
  termination.</p>

  <h3>Delivery completion notice</h3>A) Get delid of the completed
  delivery.

  <p>B) Decrement delinfo-&gt;rcptlist-&gt;dlvrcount. If it's zero,
  recycle the msgq, reread the control file. If all recipients have
  a delivery completion or failure on file, or if the message's
  expiration time has expired, r<b>emove control file from the
  queue</b>.</p>

  <p>C) Put the delinfo back on the delpfreefirst list. Move the
  delinfo's dlvrhost to the top of the MRU list.</p>

  <p>D) As long as the delpfreefirst list is not empty, do this.
  Scan the MRU list, from top to bottom. If we find a dlvrhost with
  a pending list, remove the first rcptinfo from the rcptinfo_list
  (if it's empty, remove the pendelinfo structure), remove the
  first delinfo from delpfreefirst's list, initialize it, increment
  dlvrhost's dlvrcount, send the message to the device module. If
  all dlvrhosts have null pending lists, go through the drvinfo's
  pendelinfo_list.<br />
