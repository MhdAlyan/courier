  <h1>Alias support</h1>

  <p>The <em>Courier</em> mail server's support for the address alias file
  is similar to sendmail's, but with some notable
  differences.&nbsp; Aliasing addresses to programs is not allowed,
  the alias list is strictly a list of E-mail addresses. Mail
  addressed to a name of the alias is delivered to the list of
  E-mail addresses defined for that alias.&nbsp; The name of an
  alias has no corresponding mailbox, with one exception. The alias
  may include an E-mail address that is the same as the alias name,
  in which case the mail gets delivered to this mailbox in addition
  to being sent to all the other addresses defined for that alias.
  Otherwise, if a mailbox with the same name as an alias exists, it
  will not receive any mail, as any mail addressed to it will be
  forwarded to the alias members instead.</p>

  <p>The alias file is called <code>aliases.dat</code>. The
  <em>Courier</em> mail server looks for <code>aliases.dat</code> first in
  the <code>${COURIER_HOME}/$ARCH/lib/modules/MODULE</code>
  directory. If not found, the <em>Courier</em> mail server looks for
  <code>aliases.dat</code> in <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib</code>.
  This lets you define aliases that can be mailed to only locally,
  or define system wide aliases.</p>

  <p>Please note that if
  <code>lib/modules/MODULE/aliases.dat</code> exists, and the
  E-mail address is not found there, the <em>Courier</em> mail server wll
  try again using <code>lib/aliases.dat</code>.</p>

  <h2><code>makealiases</code></h2>The <code>aliases.dat</code>
  file is created using the <code>makealiases</code> program. The
  syntax <code>makealiases</code> is as follows:
  <pre>
   makealiases -src=<em>srcfile</em> -tmp=<i>tmpfile</i> -auxtmp=<i>auxtmpfile</i> \
      [ -alias=<em>aliasfile</em> ] [-dump] [<i>module</i>]
</pre>The <code>src</code>, <code>tmp</code>, and
<code>auxtmp</code> parameters must be specified. Either the <code>
  alias</code> parameter or the <code>dump</code> flag must be
  specified.

  <p><em>srcfile</em> is a text file with alias definitions.
  <code>makealiases</code> uses two temporary files to create the
  <code>aliases.dat</code> file. You must specify the names of
  those files using the <code>tmp</code> and <code>auxtmp</code>
  parameters. aliasfile is the complete pathname to the final
  <code>aliases.dat</code> file, which should be either in the
  <code>lib</code> directory, or in the <code>MODULE</code>
  directory. <em>tmpfile</em> and <i>auxtmpfile</i> must be on the
  same filesystem as <em>aliasfile</em>.</p>

  <p>You may not have more than one instance of
  <code>makealiases</code> running at the same time, using the same
  temporary files. <code>makealiases</code> automatically removes
  the temporary files when done.</p>

  <p>It is safe to run <code>makealiases</code> while the <em>Courier</em>
  mail server is running. The new <code>aliases.dat</code> file
  takes effect immediately.</p>

  <p>All E-mail addresses in <em>srcfile</em> are rewritten to the
  canonical format. The optional <code>module</code> parameter
  specifies the module whose rewriting functions are used. If not
  specified, it defaults to <code>local</code>, so that you can
  specify addresses in srcfile without your local domain name.</p>

  <p>The <code>-dump</code> flag prevents the alias file from being
  created. Instead, <code>makealiases</code> just rewrites all the
  addresses, removes the duplicates, and displays the final alias
  list on standard output.</p>

  <p><em>srcfile</em> can be set to "-". <code>makealiases</code>
  will read alias specifications from standard input.</p>

  <h2>The alias specifications file.</h2>Blank lines in the file
  are ignored. Comments may be present on lines that start with the
  # character, which are also ignored.

  <p>An alias specification takes the form of:</p>

  <p><code>alias: address1, address2, address3 ...</code></p>

  <p>This specifies an alias whose name is alias. Mail that's sent
  to alias will be delivered to the specified list of addresses
  instead.</p>

  <p>Instead of specifying an address, another alias can be used in
  its place, inserting the contents of the second alias list into
  the first alias list.</p>

  <p>An alias specification may use mutiple lines. Start the second
  line with a tab character, or a space. For example:</p>
  <pre>
everyone: john, steve, mary, alice, tom,
          harry, gene
</pre>For example, here's a three person organization. Gloria is in
Sales, Steve is a system administrator, John does both sales and
system administrators:
  <pre>
<code>sales: john, gloria
 
sysadmin: steve, john
 
everyone: sales, sysadmin</code>
</pre>This alias file specifies that mail addressed to
'<code>sales</code>', will be delivered to the john and gloria
accounts. Mail sent to '<code>sysadmin</code>' will be delivered to
to the <code>steve</code> and <code>john</code> accounts. Mail sent
to '<code>everyone</code>' will be delievered to
<code>steve</code>, <code>john</code>, and <code>gloria</code>.
Although <code>john</code> is listed twice in the
<code>everyone</code> alias - once in the <code>sales</code> alias,
and the second time in the <code>sysadmin</code> alias -
<code>john</code> will receive only one copy of the message. The
<code>makealiases</code> command (and the <code>submit</code>
command also), automatically eliminates duplicates. Running
makealiases with the -dump flag results in the following output.
  <pre>
<code>everyone@example.com: john@example.com, gloria@example.com, steve@example.com

sysadmin@example.com: steve@example.com, john@example.com

sales@example.com: john@example.com, gloria@example.com</code>
</pre>In this example, the local domain is
'<code>@example.com</code>'. The makealiases commands automatically
converts all addresses to the canonical format.

  <p>The company grows in size, and it is now necessary for someone
  to be available 24 hours a day. Steve volunteers, and the
  following change is made:</p>
  <pre>
<code>sales: john, gloria
 
sysadmin: steve, john
 
everyone: sales, sysadmin
 
steve: steve, steve@domain.com</code>
</pre>All mail sent to <code>steve</code> will now have a second
copy mailed to <code>steve@domain.com</code>, IN ADDITION to being
delivered to the local mailbox. <code>steve@domain.com</code> is
Steve's Internet account at home. This changes affects all mail
sent to <code>steve</code>, not just to mail sent to one of the
defined aliases. Running <code>makealiases</code> with
<code>-dump</code> now results in the following output:
  <pre>
everyone@example.com: john@example.com, gloria@example.com, steve@example.com,
        steve@domain.com
 
steve@example.com: steve@example.com, steve@domain.com
 
sysadmin@example.com: steve@example.com, john@example.com, steve@domain.com
 
sales@example.com: john@example.com, gloria@example.com
</pre>This kind of forwarding should really be implemented in the
<code>.courier</code> delivery specification file in Steve's
account. Although allowed, aliases should never have the same name
as a local account. Typically, you should define aliases for <code>
  postmaster</code>, and <code>mailer-daemon</code>.

  <h2>The&nbsp; <code>-dump</code> flag</h2>The previous examples
  of <code>-dump</code> flag's output give an indication of what
  <code>makealiases</code> does:

  <ul>
    <li>All addresses are converted to the canonical format, using
    the selected module's rewrite function (called with address
    specified as <code>RW_RECIPIENT</code>).</li>

    <li>When another alias is specified, the alias's list of
    addresses is added. The output of <code>makealiases</code>
    consists of all alias references resolved, so the contents of
    all the defined aliases is just the end list of addresses.</li>

    <li>The output of the <code>-dump</code> flag can be reread by
    <font face="Abadi MT Condensed">makealiases (it's pretty safe
    to assume that if addresses are already in canonical format,
    the rewrite function does nothing)</font>. Note that some
    information is lost - namely if a list of addresses in an alias
    actually came from another alias.</li>

    <li>The order in which aliases are listed by the
    <code>-dump</code> flag is completely random.</li>

    <li>If an alias contains many addresses, <code>-dump</code> may
    list the alias in parts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The <code>aliases.dat</code> file</h2>The
  <code>aliases.dat</code> file is a GDBM (or a DB) database.
  Unless the list of addresses in a single alias is large, the
  layout is pretty basic. The GDBM/DB database is keyed by the
  alias name, and the contents of the record are the addresses
  defined by the alias. Each address is followed by a newline
  character.

  <p>In order to prevent the GDBM/DB library from consuming
  excessive amounts of memory, if an alias defines a large list of
  addresses, the list is saved in multiple records. The key of the
  second record is the alias name, followed by a newline, followed
  by "1". If a third record is necessary, it's name is the alias
  name, followed by a newline, followed by a "2". And so on.</p>

  <h2>Differences from sendmail's <code>/etc/aliases</code>
  file</h2>

  <p>Although the <em>Courier</em> mail server's implementation of
  <code>aliases.dat</code> may seem very similar to sendmail's
  <code>/etc/aliases</code> file, there are some important
  differences:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Pathnames and commands are not allowed. Only E-mail
    addresses can go into an <code>aliases.dat</code> file. To
    deliver mail to a command, or append it to a file, set aside a
    system mailbox, or a Qmail-style alias account, then create an
    appropriate <code>.courier</code> file.</li>

    <li>owner-alias is not supported.</li>

    <li>NIS maps are not supported.</li>

    <li>The "<code>foo: \foo, bar</code>" syntax is made redundant.
    Just use "<code>foo: foo, bar</code>".</li>

    <li>Finally, address rewriting implementation is obviously
    different. If you modify address rewriting code, you may need
    to rerun <code>makealiases</code> in order for the address
    rewriting changes to become effective.</li>
  </ul>
