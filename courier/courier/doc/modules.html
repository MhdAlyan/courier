  <h2>Transport Modules</h2>The directory
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib/modules</code> contains shared
  libraries and programs which provide input and output modules to
  <em>Courier</em>. The actual module itself can actually be installed and
  invoked anywhere else, the SMTP module, in fact, is installed in
  bin. The shared library in lib, however, may include functions
  which rewrite addresses for messages submitted from the input
  module. All files for module named MODULE are stored in the
  directory <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib/modules/MODULE</code>.

  <h3>The <code>modules.ctl</code> file</h3>The file
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib/modules/modules.ctl</code> contains a
  list of all the modules that <em>Courier</em> loads.
  <code>modules.ctl</code> is only used if <em>Courier</em> is compiled with
  shared library support. If <em>Courier</em> is compiled with static
  linkage only (by choice, or by necessity), all the module
  libraries are statically linked into <em>Courier</em>, and
  <code>modules.ctl</code> is not used. Each line in modules.ctl is
  in the following form:
  <em>priority</em>&lt;SP&gt;<i>name</i>&lt;SP&gt;<i>filename</i>,
  where <code>&lt;SP&gt;</code> designates the space character. The
  lines are sorted in increasing priority order! "priority" is
  taken from the module's config file, and <em>filename</em> is the
  filename of the shared library.

  <h3>Contents of <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib/modules/name</code>
  directory</h3>The following files will be found in a module
  subdirectory under lib. The name of the subdirectory is the name
  field from the <code>modules.ctl</code> file.

  <h4>config</h4>This is the module configuration file. Blank lines
  in the config file are ignored, also lines that start with the #
  character, which can be used for comments. The module
  configuration is specified using the <code>NAME=VALUE</code>
  notation, where <code>NAME</code> is the name of the
  configuration parameter, and <code>VALUE</code> is its value.

  <h4>librewrite</h4>This is the shared library that's loaded by
  <code>submit</code> and <code>courierd</code>. The shared library
  provides code to rewrite addresses to and from the canonical
  format for messages to or from this module. If <em>Courier</em> is
  compiled with static linkage, this file does not exist - the
  library is statically linked.

  <p>The actual name of the library may vary, and is specified in
  the <code>config</code> file.</p>

  <p>If this shared library does not exist, an attempt is made to
  load <code>librewrite-old</code>. This allows an updated version
  of the shared library to be installed in a live, running, system
  by renaming the current one to <code>librewrite-old</code>, then
  renaming the new one to <code>librewrite</code>.</p>

  <p>Although submit will pick up new rewriting rules immediately,
  <code>courierd</code> must be SIGHUPed in order to reload the new
  shared library.</p>

  <h4>Parameters in config</h4><code>NAME=name</code> - specifies
  the name of this module. Should be the same as the directory
  name.

  <p><code>LIBRARY=filename</code> - specifies the name of the
  shared library to load. Not used if <em>Courier</em> was compiled with
  static libraries.</p>

  <p><code>VERSION=version</code> - version of the module
  interface. Not the actual version of the module, but version of
  the interface between the module, and <em>Courier</em>. The current
  version is version 0.</p>

  <p><code>PRIORITY=n</code> - priority of the output module.
  <em>Courier</em> calls all the modules' <code>rewritedel</code> functions
  in the increasing priority order until it finds one which accepts
  messages addressed to the recipient's address.</p>

  <p><code>PROG=pathname</code> - pathname to the output module
  program. Must be a full path, unless the module itself is in the
  <code>lib/MODULE</code> directory.&nbsp; If the <code>PROG</code>
  parameter is missing, this module is an input only module. If the
  attempt to execute <code>PROG</code> fails, <em>Courier</em> will attempt
  to execute <code>PROG-old</code>, which allows an updated output
  module to be inserted into a live system by renaming the current
  one <code>PROG-old</code>, then renaming the new output module as
  <code>PROG</code>.</p>

  <p><code>MAXDELS=n</code> - maximum concurrent deliveries for
  this module. No more than these many instances of
  <code>PROG</code> will be started at any given time.</p>

  <p><code>MAXHOST=n</code> - maximum instances of
  <code>PROG</code> that will be started with the same
  <code>HOST</code> parameter.</p>

  <p><code>MAXRCPT=n</code> - maximum number of addresses that will
  be given to any single instance of <code>PROG</code>.</p>

  <p>Please note that although these parameters are reread by
  <code>courierd</code> when it restarts, the individual output
  module may impose its own restrictions on the valid limits for
  these parameters.</p>

  <h3>Module library functions</h3>The module library contains the
  following functions. In each case, <code>XXXX</code> is used to
  represent the name of the function in the library for module
  <code>XXXX</code>. For example, in the "local" module, the
  <code>rw_install</code> function is called
  <code>local_rw_install</code>.

  <p><code>struct rw_list *XXXX_rw_install(const struct
  rw_install_info *info);</code></p>

  <p>The <code>rw_install()</code> function is called after the
  shared library is open. It receives a pointer to the following
  structure:</p>
  <pre>
struct rw_install_info {
        int rw_verlo;
        int rw_verhi;
        const char *courier_home;
        } ;
</pre><code>rw_verlo/rw_verhi</code> - reserved for future
expansion. Currently set to 0. <code>rw_install</code> function of
modules compatible with this <em>Courier</em> interface must check that
<code>rw_verlo</code> is set to 0, and ignore
<code>rw_verhi</code>.

  <p><code>courier_home</code> - <em>Courier</em>'s home directory, the
  shared library can use this to find its files.</p>

  <h3>The <code>rw_search</code> function</h3>
  <pre>
struct rw_list *rw_search(const char *);
</pre>The <code>rw_search</code> function can be called by a
library function in order to return the rw_list (see below)
structure of a function in another library. <code>rw_search</code>
may NOT be called form <code>XXXX_rw_install</code>, because the
library containing this function may not've been installed yet.
<code>rw_search</code> may be called from the
<code>XXXX_rw_init</code> function.

  <p><code>const char *XXXX_rw_init()</code></p>

  <p>After all modules are installed, each module's
  <code>rw_init()</code> function is called, which can complete any
  additional setup. <code>rw_init</code> should return a null
  pointer. Otherwise, <code>rw_init</code> should return the error
  message text. <em>Courier</em> will refuse to start if
  <code>rw_init</code> does not return a null pointer.</p>

  <p>The library's <code>rw_install</code> function must return a
  pointer to the following structure. If <code>rw_install</code>
  returns a NULL pointer, <em>Courier</em> will refuse to start.</p>
  <pre>
struct rw_list {
        int rw_version;
        void (*rewrite)(struct rw_info *info, void (*func)(struct rw_info *));
        void (*rewrite_del)(struct rw_info *info, void (*func)(struct rw_info *),
                    void (*delfunc)(struct rw_info *info, const struct rfc822token *host,
                                const struct rfc822 *addr));
        int  (*filter_msg)(const char *,
                        int,
                        const char *,
                        const char *,
                        const char *,

                        char *,
                        unsigned);
} ;
</pre><code>rw_version</code> - shared libraries compatible with
this module interface must set rw_version to zero.

  <p><code>rewrite</code> - this function is called to rewrite a
  single address. The first argument points to the following
  structure:<br />
  &nbsp;</p>
  <pre>
<code>struct rw_info {
    int mode;
    struct rfc822token *ptr;
    void (*err_func)(int, const char *, struct rw_info *);
    const struct rfc822token *sender;
    const char *smodule;
    void *udata;
} ;</code>
</pre><code>mode</code> contains the following values, ORed into a
bitmask: <code>RW_ENVSENDER</code> - rewrite envelope sender,
<code>RW_ENVRECIPIENT</code> - rewrite envelope recipient,
<code>RW_HEADER</code> - rewrite header. When calling
<code>rewrite()</code>, one of these three bits will be set.
Additional bits that may be set: <code>RW_OUTPUT</code> -
<code>rewrite</code>() should convert canonical format to the
transport format. If this bit is not set, rewrite should convert
from the transport format to the canonical format. In fact, the
main <code>courierd</code> does not call rewrite with the
<code>RW_OUTPUT</code> bit set, because that function is performed
by the dedicated output module, which may handle rewriting on its
own. Also, the <code>RW_SUBMIT</code> can be set together with
<code>RW_ENVSENDER</code> or <code>RW_ENVRECIPIENT</code>,
indicating that this call is as a result of a message being
submitted for delivery (as opposed to address verification for
<code>EXPN/VRFY</code> functionality).

  <p>It is possible that none of those bits are set, when invoked
  by another rewrite function.</p>

  <p><code>ptr</code> is the address to rewrite, as rfc822
  tokens.</p>

  <p><code>udata</code> contains an arbitrary pointer, for usage by
  rewrite's caller.</p>

  <p>When mode has <code>RW_ENVRECIPIENT</code> set,
  <code>sender</code> points to the envelope sender format in the
  canonical format (previous result of <code>RW_ENVSENDER</code>),
  otherwise this field is unused. If <code>sender</code> is NULL,
  this should be interpreted as an empty envelope sender (or if
  <code>rewrite</code> is being called in test mode.</p>

  <p><code>smodule</code> is initialized when mode has the
  <code>RW_SUBMIT</code> bit set. It will point to the name of the
  module argument to submit - the module sending the message.</p>

  <p><code>err_func</code> is the function to call in case of an
  error.</p>

  <p><code>rewrite</code> is expected to call either
  <code>func</code>, (it's second argument), or
  <code>err_func</code>, before returning. If rewriting succeeds,
  <code>func</code> is called. If rewriting failed,
  <code>rewrite</code> must call the <code>err_func</code> is
  function. <code>errcode</code> will be the RFC822-style error
  number, <code>errmsg</code> is the error message, which may be
  multiline (includes newlines). The text in <code>errmsg</code> is
  NOT prefixed by the error number.</p>

  <p>After calling <code>func</code>, or <code>err_func</code>,
  <code>rewrite</code> is expected to immediately terminate.
  <code>rewrite</code> may alter the 'ptr' link list in any form or
  fashion it wants, except that it may NOT malloc or free any node,
  or a part thereof. However, it can relink portions of the link
  list, or modify the link pointers to include tokens created by
  <code>rewrite</code> internally.</p>

  <p>After <code>func</code> or <code>err_func</code> terminates,
  <code>rewrite</code> may deallocate everything it allocated, then
  terminate itself.</p>

  <p>This interface allows rewrite to execute very quickly, without
  allocating or deallocating any memory. If new RFC822 tokens are
  required, they can be allocated on the stack, and linked into the
  original list.</p>

  <p>The <code>rewrite_del</code> function is called to determine
  if the module can accept delivery of a message to this address.
  The <code>rewrite_del</code> of all installed libraries are
  called until one of them calls the <code>delfunc</code> function.
  If <code>rewrite_del</code> cannot accept delivery of a message,
  it should call <code>func</code>. The <code>rewrite_del</code>
  function should call the <code>delfunc</code> function to
  indicate that this module can accept mail addressed to the
  address specified by <code>info-&gt;ptr</code>.
  <code>rewrite_del</code> receives the pointer to the rw_info
  structure, then the <code>host</code> and the
  <code>address</code> information for the output module, as
  rfc822token lists. If the mode field has the
  <code>RW_SUBMIT</code> bit set, rewrite_del can find the
  message's envelope sender address in canonical format) in
  <code>info-&gt;sender</code>.</p>

  <p>Like <code>rewrite</code>, <code>rewrite_del</code> may make
  arbitrary changes to <code>info-&gt;ptr</code>, except that it
  may not deallocate memory used for the existing list.
  <code>rewrite_del</code> may modify the link list, and allocate
  memory for new rfc822 tokens. After calling either
  <code>func</code> or <code>delfunc</code>,
  <code>rewrite_del</code> should terminate immediately, and
  deallocate any allocated memory. <code>rewrite_del</code> must
  keep track of any allocated memory separate, and cannot assume
  that <code>info-&gt;ptr</code> hasn't changed.</p>

  <p>When <code>RW_SUBMIT</code> bit is set,
  <code>rewrite_del</code> can be used to perform additional
  recipient-specific code, which may be too expensive to run every
  time courier goes through the queue. The <code>udata</code> field
  contains a pointer to caller-specific data. The
  <code>sender</code> field contains a pointer to the envelope
  sender, in canonical format. Like <code>rewrite</code>,
  <code>rewrite_del</code> may muck around with the
  <code>rfc822token</code> list in <code>ptr</code>.
  <code>rewrite_del</code> functions are called in order according
  to the configured module priority. By setting a higher priority,
  it is possible to have <code>rewrite_del</code> rewrite the
  address so that it would be accepted by another module's
  <code>rewrite_del</code>, down the chain.<br /></p>

  <p>The last function, <code>rw_filter_msg</code>, is called to
  run an arbitrary spam filter which can be used to selectively
  reject messages. <code>rw_filter_msg</code> will be called after
  <code>rewrite_del</code> accepted the message for delivery. The
  arguments are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The name of the module that is submitting this message for
    delivery.</li>

    <li>Either a read-only file descriptor, containing the copy of
    the message, or -1.</li>

    <li>The 'host' return value from <code>rewrite_del</code>, as a
    text string.</li>

    <li>The 'addr' return value from <code>rewrite_del</code>, as a
    text string.</li>

    <li>The message envelope return address.</li>

    <li>A pointer to a buffer where the error message can be
    saved.</li>

    <li>How large the buffer is, in bytes.</li>
  </ul>This function is called twice: once when submit receives the
  recipient address (file descriptor is -1), and the second time
  after the message is received, but before it is accepted.
  Therefore, this function should execute quickly. Also note that
  ESMTP does not have a well-defined way to selectively reject
  messages to individual recipients once the contents of the
  message are received. If a message is addressed to multiple
  recipients, and at at least one recipient's filter rejects the
  message, <em>Courier</em> replies with a rejection code, and the sending
  mail server will assume that the message to all recipients has
  failed.

  <p><code>rw_filter_msg</code> should return 0 if the message is
  acceptable, a negative value to permanently reject the message to
  this recipient, and a positive value for a temporary
  rejection.<br />
  &nbsp;</p>

  <h4>Running <code>PROG</code></h4><code>PROG</code> is the output
  module that will be started by <em>Courier</em> when it comes up. PROG can
  be a shell command, it is executed via "<code>$SHELL -c</code>".
  It will be started under userid mail, group mail, in
  <code>${COURIER_HOME}/lib/modules/NAME</code>. <em>Courier</em> will
  communicate with <code>PROG</code> on standard input and output.

  <p>If <code>PROG</code> succesfully initializes, it should fork,
  and the parent should exit with status of 0. <em>Courier</em> waits until
  <code>PROG</code> exits. If it exits with a non-0 exit code,
  <em>Courier</em> will fail starting up. The child process will then
  continue to read and write from standard output.</p>

  <p><code>COURIER_HOME</code>, <code>MAXDELS</code>,
  <code>MAXHOST</code>, and <code>MAXRCPTS</code> will be placed in
  the environment, prior to executing <code>PROG</code>.</p>

  <p>Tip: if the environment variables are not set,
  <code>PROG</code> can presume that it's being run in test mode,
  from the command line, and forego the fork.</p>

  <p>If <code>PROG</code> terminates, <em>Courier</em> will consider it a
  fatal error (<em>Courier</em> detects the input channel being closed).</p>

  <p>If <code>PROG</code> gets an end-of-file indication, it can
  assume that <em>Courier</em> is being shut down, so it should promptly
  cease all activities, without waiting for pending messages to be
  delivered.</p>

  <p>To start delivery for a particular message, <code>PROG</code>
  will receive a newline-terminated command, specifying the
  message, and the recipients, and the delivery ID. Once
  <code>PROG</code> finishes delivering messages, <code>PROG</code>
  should write the results of the delivery into the message's
  control file, then print the delivery ID on its standard output,
  terminated by newline.&nbsp; If the module's config file
  specifies that the module can handle multiple deliveries at the
  same time, <code>PROG</code> may receive additional deliveries
  before it finishes delivering the first message.</p>

  <p>The command that prog receives is a newline-terminated line
  that looks like this:</p>

  <p>
  msgnum&lt;tab&gt;sender&lt;tab&gt;delid&lt;tab&gt;host&lt;tab&gt;num1&lt;tab&gt;addr1&lt;tab&gt;num2&lt;tab&gt;addr2...</p>

  <p>&lt;tab&gt; represents the ASCII tab character. This is
  basically a list of tab-separated fields. The first field is the
  message id number (the inode number).</p>

  <p>sender is the message envelope sender, after it's rewritten to
  the module format, by the module shared library.</p>

  <p>delid is the "delivery ID", which is a small integer,
  representing this delivery. After <code>PROG</code> finishes
  delivering the message, it should print the message's delivery ID
  on standard output after saving the delivery status of each
  recipient in the control file.</p>

  <p>The host field specifies the host where the message should be
  delivered to, as determined by the module's output rewrite rule.
  Following the host, there will be one or more num/address pairs.
  address is the recipient's address as determined by the output
  rewrite rule, and num is the recipient's number in the message's
  list of recipients (this is used to save the delivery status in
  the control file). Note that the address can be an empty string,
  so there will be two consecutive tabs there.<br />
