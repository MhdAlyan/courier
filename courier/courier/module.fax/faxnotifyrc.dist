# This configuration file sets up options for Courier's new_fax script.
# This is an optional script that can be installed as mgetty's new_fax
# script to automatically convert incoming faxes to PNG files, and mail
# them to the selected recipient.
#
# Consult mgetty's documentation for instructions how to install a new_fax
# notification script.  The default mgetty configuration installs the new_fax
# script either in /etc/mgetty+sendfax/new_fax or
# /usr/local/lib/etc/mgetty+sendfax/new_fax.
