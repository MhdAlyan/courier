#
# courierfax configuration directives.  These directives specify which
# phone numbers courierfax will dial, as well as some basic transformation
# rules.  The default set of directives are designed for the North American
# Number Plan dialing: seven digit local number, 1+10 digit area code.
#
# This should really be done by a Perl script, for maximum flexibility,
# however loading the Perl interpreter into the mail server code is just too
# much, so we're left with what we have.
#
# Blank lines in this file are ignored.  Lines that begin with # are comments,
# and are also ignored.  Because this file is processed by sysconftool,
# do not add comments in the middle or at the tail end of the configuration
# directives, otherwise you'll lose them on upgrades.  All the comments go
# here.
#
# There are two basic directives:
#
#   rw[flags]      [search]   [replace]
#
#   accept[flags]  [search]   [source]
#
#   reject[flags]  [search]   [source]
#
#  "Pattern" is described below.  The 'rw' directive rewrites the phone number.
#  If the phone number matches the "search" pattern, it is replaced with
#  "replace", and we continue to the next directive.  If the phone number
#  doesn't match 'search', we go on to the next directive.
#
#  The 'accept' directive "accepts" the phone number.  If the phone number
#  matches the "search" pattern, and the mail originates from "source", the
#  phone number is accepted.  "source" must be one of the following strings:
#  local, esmtp, uucp, dsn.  This allows, for example, to send faxes only
#  from locally-originated mail, and not for mail received via ESMTP.
#
#  The 'reject' directive is the opposite of 'accept'.  If the phone number
#  matches the "search" pattern, and the mail originates from "source", the
#  phone number is immediately rejected, without further processing.
#
#  Note that after the 'accept' directive is processed, courierfax continues
#  to process the rest of the file.  When the entire faxrc file is read,
#  courierfax determines if the phone number was accepted, if not the message
#  is bounced.
#
#  Therefore, the overall strategy is as follows:
#
#  1) Issue 'rw' directives that rewrite the phone number into a 'canonical'
#     form.  For NANPA, it's either a 10-digit phone number (without 1+), or
#     011 followed by an international phone number.
#
#  2) Issue accept directives.  Here, it's still possible to discriminate,
#     in the sample case, between international and local phone numbers.
#
#  3) Issue 'rw' directives that post-process the phone number, for example:
#     drop the default area code, prepend any dialing prefixes, such as "9,".
#
#  The 'rw' and 'accept' directives may be followed by the following
#  characters:
#
#  ^    It is sufficient for the pattern to match the phone number's prefix
#       only.  Normally, the pattern must match the entire phone number.
#
#  *    If the pattern matches, lather, rinse, and repeat.  Only meaningful for
#       the 'rw' directive.
#
#  SEARCH
#
#  The "search" string is compared against the phone number, verbatim, except
#  for the following character sequences:
#
#  n      The 'n' character in the search pattern matches any digit in the
#         phone number (there are other things in the phone number, you know,
#         such as *, #, and commas).
#
#  .      The '.' character in the search pattern will match any single
#         character in the phone number.
#
#  ( .. ) Stuff inside the parenthesis is compared against the phone number,
#         and if it matches, it is made available in the replacement string
#         as "$1".  The second occurence of () is made available in the
#         replacement string as "$2".  Up to eight parenthesis pairs may be
#         specified and they may not nest.
#
#  ~      Matches the DTMF '#' character in the phone number.  Because the
#         DTMF character '#' conflicts with the comment character in this
#         configuration file, the ~ character represents the DTMF # character
#         in this configuration file.
#
#  -      Matches the , character in the dialing string.  Since commas are used
#         in E-mail headers to separate addresses, a dash in the local part
#         of the E-mail address is translated to a comma in the dialing string.
#
#  +      Matches the @ character in the dialing string.  Since @s are used
#         in E-mail addresses for other purposes, a + in the local part of
#         the E-mail address is replaced with the @ character in the dialing
#         string.
#
#  Anything else in the search pattern must match the phone number string
#  verbatim.
#
#  REPLACE
#
#  If the SEARCH string matches the phone number, it is replaced by the
#  REPLACE string, and the next line in this configuration file is read.
#  $1, $2 ... $8 in REPLACE is replaced by the corresponding parts of the
#  original phone number, as designated by the ( .. ) pairs.  When the
#  'rw' keyword is followed by '^', trailing parts of the original phone
#  number are available as $9.
#
#
#  EXPLANATION OF DEFAULT REWRITING RULES.
#
#  Here's the explanation the default set of configuration directives
#  from the Courier distribution.  The default set of configuration directives
#  is for the North American dialing plan, with a nonexistent local area code
#  of "999", that uses seven digit local dialing.
#
#  Step 1: Convert all phone numbers to canonical form: a ten digit
#  areacode+phone number, or a variable length international phone number that
#  begins with 1:
#
#  rw^*    1               $9
#
#        -- first things first: remove all leading 1s from the phone #
#
#  rw^     011             1011$9
#  rw^     n11             1
#  rw^     1011            011$9
#
#        -- now, what this is all about is that we want to reject all
#           phone numbers that begin with x11 (such as 911, you don't want
#           to send any faxes there, of course),  EXCEPT for the international
#           011 prefix.  Therefore, we first prepend a "1" to all 011 numbers
#           then replace ANY number that begins with x11 with a single
#           digit 1 (that's the entire phone number, which gets later rejected
#           as an invalid).  Finally, we lop replace 1011 with 011.
#
#  rw      (nnnnnnn)       999$1
#
#        -- Prefix the default area code of "999" to all seven digit numbers.
#
# Step 2: Accept all valid numbers to dial
#
# accept   2nnnnnnnnn   local
# accept   2nnnnnnnnn   esmtp
#
# ...
#
# accept   9nnnnnnnnn   local
# accept   9nnnnnnnnn   esmtp
#
#  So, we now accept all 10 digit numbers that begin with 2 through 9 as
#  valid.  "accept [whatever] local" accepts this number from local senders,
#  and "accept [whatever] esmtp" accepts this number from remote (esmtp)
#  senders.
#
#  Do not specify the 'dsn' module, unless you have no problems with some
#  joker causing your server to fax-bomb someone with bounces.
#
#  Now, listing "esmtp" does not automatically allow anyone in the world to
#  send faxes.  You still need to set FAXRELAYCLIENT, as described in the
#  following note:
#
#  NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
#
#   Some mail clients, like Pine, send mail via ESMTP to localhost (usually
#   by running 'sendmail -bs').  That looks like esmtp mail to courierfax,
#   therefore the default configuration, below, also accepts esmtp.  HOWEVER:
#   faxes are accepted via ESMTP only after an additional requirement of the
#   FAXRELAYCLIENT envuironment variable being set, which is typically
#   implemented by setting FAXRELAYCLIENT for authorized IP address ranges
#   only (and FAXRELAYCLIENT is automatically set by sendmail -bs, and by
#   authenticated via ESMTP).
#
#  NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE
#
#
# accept^ 011    local
# accept^ 011    esmtp
#
#       -- This allows faxes to be sent to international phone numbers.
#          Remove these two lines to block faxes to international numbers.
#
# Step 3 - we're almost there.  Time to specify how numbers should be dialed.
#
# rw^    (.)       1$1$9
# rw^    1011      011$9
# rw^    1999      $9
#
#       -- First, we prepend 1 to every number, then remove it for
#          international calls.  So now we have two possibilities:
#          a) 011+international number, and b) 1+10 digit area code.
#
#          Finally, we want all numbers in the 999 area code to be dialed
#          as ten digits.  Numbers in the 999 area code are currently
#          prefixed with "1999", so we drop that.
#
#  OPTIONAL EXTRA:
#
#  rw^   (.)       9,$1$9
#
#       -- This prepends "9," to every phone number dialed.  Append this
#          extra rule at the very end, to take effect for any number.
#
#  ALTERNATIVE #1: ten digit local calling.
#  Some areas in North America dial ten digit for local calls (in a small
#  number of area codes), and 1+ten digits for all other area codes.
#  Say that our local calling area includes the 999 and 998 area codes,
#  which must be dialed 10 digits, with 1+10 digits for everyone else.
#  Here's the third portion of the rewriting rules that accomplishes that:
#
#  rw^    (.)       1$1$9
#  rw^    1011      011$9
#  rw^    1999      999$9
#  rw^    1998      998$9
#
#  Think - you should be able to figure out how this works, by now.
#
#  IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT IMPORTANT
#
#  Remove the first 'rw' line below - "rw^   .    1" - this is a hack to
#  disable fax transmission in the default Courier install, so that it has
#  to be manually enabled.  After removing the first 'rw' line, everything
#  above this paragraph becomes applicable!
